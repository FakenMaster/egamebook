Still trying to stay low, you look around. You're surrounded by paper Ikea boxes. There's a long-lost sock behind one of them, but that probably won't be too helpful right now.

You realize that one of the boxes is where you keep your sports stuff. You open it and skim over swimwear, tennis balls, rackets &mdash; nothing of interest. Just before you almost quit, you get to the very bottom of the box and find a *baseball bat*.

<script>
/* alert("Baseball bat taken.") */
</script> 

Even though the bat won't help much against a sniper, you decide to take it with you. God knows who awaits you in the hall or downstairs or in front of the house. The bat won't slow you down and it *might* come in handy.

With the bat in your hand, you look accross the room. The phone is still ringing.

What is your next step?

* [Run to the other side](RunAroundBed.html), around the bed.
* [Roll over the bed](RollOverBed.html).
* [Wait a second or two](WaitInCorner.html) to calm down and take a breath.
