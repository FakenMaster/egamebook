You decide you need to calm down and take a deep breath. Some things can't be rushed, right?

Well, it turns out _some_ things actually **have** to be rushed. As you wait, it gets harder and harder to decide on the right time to start running. Meanwhile, the shooter reloads and dutifully prepares for the second shot.

When you finally decide to run, you make only a few leaps before the bullet hits you in the hip.

You don't die on the spot. Instead, you fall down, paralyzed by shock and pain and broken pelvis. You lie next to your bed and watch a pool of sticky blood extend from below your body.

Your heart beats at an unbelievable rate as you realize you've made the fatal mistake. 

They're coming to get you.
