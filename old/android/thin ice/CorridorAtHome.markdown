There is a huge cubist painting of a vagina in front of you.

That's right. A vagina. You're a gynaecologist and this in front of you is your father's idea of a graduation gift. You remember how everyone &mdash; including your father &mdash; was surprised you would actually hang the painting in your home. Your mother hates it. Your sister hates it. 

You, however, find it appropriate. Seeing an average of ten different vaginas a day means that you don't really mind seeing another one when home. Hanging it in the hall upstairs was a mix between playing along with your father's joke and rebelling against the conventional shame of such things.
