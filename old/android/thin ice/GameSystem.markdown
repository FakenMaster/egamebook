The Game System
---------------

You may be familiar with the traditional Hit Points based game system of many gamebooks and computer games. Typically, the player of such a game has a set number of Hit Points and when he gets harmed, an amount of his Hit Points is deducted. When Hit Points reach zero, the player is dead.

**This game is not Hit Points based.** In the real world &mdash; and in most fiction &mdash; when you get hit with an axe, or when you get shot by a rocket launcher, you're most certainly dead. No ammount of potions or medikits will help you.

Take **James Bond**, for example. Have you ever seen James Bond being shot several times in the head and still running around, searching for bandaids? I don't think so. When James Bond is being shot at, he typically **gets lucky enough not to be shot** in the first place. The bullets fly all over the place, but none hits him (unless he's being _really_ foolish, of course).

To reflect this, the game system is based on Luck. Every fictional hero seems to have a lot of luck, but it's not unlimited of course &mdash; sometimes even the best of heroes *run out of luck*. Therefore, it makes sense to quantify luck as **Luck Points**.

**Example:** Let's say you have 20 Luck Points. When a poor marksman with a pistol shoots at you from a great distance, he most certainly misses &mdash; you stay alive, but you may loose 1-2 Luck Points. If you decide to stay still, the next shot may cost you even more luck points. If you stay still for long enough, the guy with a pistol will eventually hit you. At that point, you are dead.

Naturally, the amount of Luck Points an event consumes depends largely on its **chance of success**. So while the above example costs you only 1-2 Luck Points, surviving a heads-on car collision will cost you much more. So if you only have a few Luck Points left, don't take the chance. You'll die.

Apart from being a lot more believable, the Luck based system also allows for some neat gameplay features. For example, when you have a lot of Luck Points, you may choose to sacrifice them and **try something very unlikely** &mdash; you know, like in the movies. Jumping out of a window and landing safely on the cloth roof of a conveniently placed truck qualifies as one such feat &mdash; yet it's so common in adventure books and movies that we don't even raise our eyebrows when we see it.

**Now you know everything you need to play this gamebook.** To be successful, watch your Luck Points closely, don't do anything extremely stupid, but don't be afraid to take a chance once in a while, too. Remember you're playing a game*book*, so interesting and unlikely things are bound to happen.

Good luck!
