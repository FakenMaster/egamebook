<p>You decide you need to calm down and take a deep breath. Some things can't be rushed, right?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out <em>some</em> things actually <strong>have</strong> to be rushed. As you wait, it gets harder and harder to decide on the right time to start running. Meanwhile, the shooter reloads and dutifully prepares for the second shot.</p>
<p>When you finally decide to run, you make only a few leaps before the bullet hits you in the hip.</p>
<p>You don't die on the spot. Instead, you fall down, paralyzed by shock and pain and broken pelvis. You lie next to your bed and watch a pool of sticky blood extend from below your body.</p>
<p>Your heart beats at an unbelievable rate as you realize you've made the fatal mistake. </p>
<p>They're coming to get you.</p>
