<p>You push off of the wall to gain momentum in as little space as you got. </p>
<p>You swiftly run around the bed to the other side of the room, where the phone is still ringing. At the instant you duck to grab it, you hear a strident <em>CRACK!</em> as a second bullet flies in through the window and hits the wall. </p>

<p>With the phone in your hand, you scramble to the door, open it, slip out of the room and quickly make your way along the corridor as far from the bedroom as possible.</p>
