<div id="matrioska">
<p>You push off of the wall to gain momentum in as little space as you got. </p>
<p>You roll over the bed. You feel little shards of glass stick into your palms and elbows, but the softness of your bed prevents them from cutting you. </p>
<p>You hear a strident <em>CRACK!</em> as a bullet hits the wall across from the bed and creates a large crater in the plastering. Fortunately, you were faster than the shooter's reaction. It's only after you fall on the floor on the other side of your bed when you hear the gunshot that sent the missed bullet.</p>
