<h2>Stay in Bed</h2>
<p>You decide it's just a bad dream. Ignoring the sound of glass shattering on the floor, you close your eyes and try to revive the dream you just had. </p>
<p>It doesn't come, though.</p>
<p>A few seconds pass and then a bullet cuts violently through your flesh, opening a hole in your right lung. You try to breathe in, but it's too painful and you choke. </p>
<p>Blood floods your right shoulder. Even before you realize you're dying, another bullet flies through your head and disconnects most of the crucial circuitry there.</p>
<p>You die.</p>
