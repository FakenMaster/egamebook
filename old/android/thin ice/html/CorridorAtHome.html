<div id="matrioska">
<p>There is a huge cubist painting of a vagina in front of you.</p>
<p><img alt="Cubist vagina" src="images/cubist-v.jpg" /></p>
<p>That's right. A vagina. You're a gynaecologist and this in front of you is your father's idea of a graduation gift. You remember how everyone &mdash; including your father &mdash; was surprised you would actually hang the painting in your home. Your mother hates it. Your sister hates it. </p>
<p>You, however, find it appropriate. Seeing an average of ten different vaginas a day means that you don't really mind seeing another one when home. Hanging it in the hall upstairs was a mix between playing along with your father's joke and rebelling against the conventional shame of such things.</p>
