<h2>(Section &mdash; 169)</h2>
<p>"Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: This is Commander Carlson, we've got some bad news. Coming up to the Control Centre, we've found the non-human officers of the space station. They're all dead," Carlson spoke into the microphone built into his environmental suit's helmet.</p>
<p><em>"What in blazes happened?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"We've found traces of the same dangerous drug in their bloodstreams. It seems that to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians, the chemical compound is lethal," Carlson explained.</p>
<p class="P12">"So the other eighty or so residents of the space station..."</p>
<p>"Are presumably dead as well, Captain."</p>
<p><em>"What the- where did they come from? Lieutenant Lewis, identify that incoming vessel,"</em> the Task Group heard Captain Donaldson speaking to the starship's helmsman. There was a short pause.</p>
<p><em>"Sir, it's the Sunriser - a Cassian navy cruiser,"</em> they heard Lieutenant Lewis reply.</p>
<p><em>"A navy vessel? What's it doing out here? This isn't a military zone? Commander Carlson, I'll have to get back to you, I've got my hands full here. Find out how this drug got into everyone's bloodstream - we may need that information quite soon. Ulysses out,"</em> the captain signed off.</p>
<ul><li>“Let's check the command consoles, and see if these people left any records of their final hours,” Carlson said, and walked over to a main console. <a class="turnToSection" href="s114.html">(Turn to Section 114)</a></li><li>“I can run scans on the water systems, and see if the drug is in the water supply,” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s148.html">(Turn to Section 148)</a></li></ul>
