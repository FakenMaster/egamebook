<h2>(Section &mdash; 1)</h2>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Federation of Worlds contains six advanced species' home worlds, with hundreds of colonies, space stations and outposts. For over a hundred years, the six major species (those capable of interstellar travel) have lived in relative peace.</p>
<p>The <em>F.S.S. Ulysses</em> is a human starship of the Federation Stellar Services, designed to carry out non-military roles, such as scientific exploration, providing medical aid, and performing diplomatic duties. However, the crew have been called to aid the military branch of the Federation Stellar Services on numerous occasions in the past, and while not as heavily armed or armoured as a military cruiser, her twin starship-scale particle cannons still pack quite a punch.</p>
<p><strong>The story so far:</strong></p>
<p>A distress call was received at Starbase 14 from Pegasi Station, a mixed-species space station located in Sector 17. All the humans aboard Pegasi Station had fallen ill with a mysterious virus, and the starship <em>Ulysses</em> was quickly dispatched to examine the situation, and hopefully to develop a cure – before the humans died.</p>
<p>At the time of the distress call, the non-humans (aliens) at the space station all seemed to be in fine health, and Federation High Command was worried that someone might have created a virus that targeted humans only – a bio-weapon that could threaten the entire human race!</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> was around twenty-four hours away from the space station when the new orders came in, but it was the closest ship. They had orders to reach the space station with all due haste, and they hoped that when they arrived, the humans would still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>How to read this gamebook:</strong></p>
<p>In this gamebook, instead of playing a single character, you decide how numerous characters in the story will react to the situations they are faced with. You will be presented with options of things people say or do, and the story will move forward according to the options you choose.</p>
<p>Instead of reading this page-by-page as you would read a novel, each option you can choose tells you to turn to a certain paragraph section of the book to continue the story.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Security Chief Blake Thomas shouted, “We should attack them now, Captain!” (<em>Turn to Section - 7)</em></li></ul><p>As you look through the book, you will see section numbers in bold text. For example, section eight would be shown as <span class="T4">(Section - 8)</span>. Simply choose the path you wish the story to take, and flip through the book to find the section it referred you to, and continue reading from there.</p>
<p>As the story unfolds, you will determine how the crew handles the situations they are faced with, and ultimately, whether they succeed or fail.</p>
<p>Lastly, unlike many gamebooks, you do not require a pencil or piece of paper to keep track of information. However, while playing this adventure, you might be asked to remember something simple.</p>
<p>This will rarely happen, but if you come across it, and you feel you cannot remember it, write it down on a scrap of paper. In such cases, you will be given two options later on, asking if you did, or did not perform a certain action. Each option will refer you to a different section of the story to continue.</p>
<ul><li>You can learn more about the main characters aboard the <em>Ulysses</em> by reading the next section, <a class="turnToSection" href="s2.html">Section - 2</a>.</li> <li>Otherwise, you can turn to <a class="turnToSection" href="s3.html">Section - 3</a> and begin playing.</li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 2)</h2>
<h1>The Crew</h1>
<p>This section lists the main characters that serve aboard the <em>F.S.S. Ulysses</em>, and tells you a little about them.</p>
<p><strong>The Captain:</strong></p>
<p>Captain Jeffrey Donaldson is in his mid-forties, and was assigned to the <em>Ulysses </em>following its commissioning two years before the events in this adventure. He is a male human of average height, balding, with a close-trimmed goatee and moustache. His hair is dark brown, beginning to show streaks of grey. This is his second captaincy, his first being aboard the <em>F.S.S. Endeavour</em> for eight years.</p>
<p><strong>The First Officer:</strong></p>
<p>Commander Evan Carlson is a human male, in his mid-thirties, and served with Captain Donaldson aboard the <em>F.S.S. Endeavour</em> as First Officer there as well. The captain was so impressed with him that he made a request to have the commander reassigned aboard the <em>Ulysses</em> before its maiden voyage.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief of Security:</strong></p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Blake Thomas is a human male, in his mid-thirties. He is skilled in many forms of combat, from unarmed, martial arts duelling, to heavy weapons and demolitions devices. He also shares the starship's weapon systems with Lieutenant Lewis, the ship's Chief Helmsman. </p>
<p>While he will obey any superior's orders without question, Captain Donaldson has noted Blake's tendency to fight first, and ask questions later. The captain hopes that aboard a non-military starship, in peaceful sectors of space, Blake will learn that sometimes the right words can negate hostilities before fighting becomes necessary.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief Engineer:</strong></p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Terrance Idato is a quiet, thoughtful human male, aged in his late thirties. He is more at home among machinery, computers and electronic devices than among his fellow crewmates, but without his skilled mind and hands, it would be impossible to keep the four-hundred-and-forty-metre long starship in top shape.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief Medical Officer:</strong></p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Susan Anderson, usually just called Doctor Anderson, heads the medical teams aboard the starship <em>Ulysses</em>. She is a human female, aged in her early forties. Doctor Anderson has a powerful intellect, and has taken part in the development of numerous beneficial medical discoveries over the last fifteen years.</p>
<p><strong>The Counsellor:</strong></p>
<p>Lieutenant Miva Lontira is a female Vesarian, an empathic humanoid species capable of sensing the emotions and intentions of other people. Vesarians were the first species humanity encountered as they began travelling to the stars, and the more advanced Vesarians took on a role of advisers and counsellors to the human race. </p>
<p>Most human starships have a Vesarian aboard in the position of ship's counsellor, aiding humans in their dealings with other beings they encounter.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief Science Officer:</strong></p>
<p>Lieutenant Johan Gregari is a human male in his mid-twenties. He holds a fascination with anything that has yet to be understood by mankind. Lieutenant Gregari has a good understanding of the alien species that are part of the Federation of Worlds, and spends his time learning more about alien technologies and sciences.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief Helmsman:</strong></p>
<p>Lieutenant Michael Lewis is a human male, in his mid-twenties. He pilots the starship, and shares the operation of ship's weapon systems with Blake, the Chief of Security.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief Navigator:</strong></p>
<p>Ensign Robert Hobb is a human male, aged in his early twenties, and is in charge of ship navigation. This is the young officer's first tour of duty as an officer aboard a starship, and he hopes to make a good impression on the Captain and his crew.</p>
<p><strong>The Chief Communications Officer:</strong></p>
<p>Ensign Sophia Tremane is a human female, aged in her early twenties, and is in charge of the communications systems aboard the starship. She is fascinated by languages, and can speak fluently with Vesarians and Cassians in their native tongue. This is her first tour of duty as an officer aboard a starship.</p>

<h1>Episode One</h1>
<p><strong>Captain's Log</strong></p>
<p><strong>Year 112 of the Federation, Starday 336.</strong></p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>I have received our latest mission details from Admiral Branson. We have been directed to the Banaha System in Sector 17, where the humans aboard Pegasi Station have fallen ill to an unknown virus. It would seem that the other species there are immune to this mystery illness, and we hope that the science bays aboard the Ulysses will help us identify the virus, and with some hope, a cure.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Admiral Branson has also expressed concern that this virus may, in fact, be a bio-weapon, targeted against humanity by any one of the hostile species known to the Federation of Worlds. Why humanity alone would be targeted by a bio-weapon is unknown. However, it is a possibility we cannot afford to rule out.</blockquote>
<blockquote>My crew have seen me through some tough situations in the past two years, and I have every faith in their ability to aid the humans at Pegasi Station, and to get to the heart of this matter. I pray that this space virus is from no malevolent source, for if another species were indeed testing some new type of bio-weapon against humanity, it would certainly be the opening act of a war to come.</blockquote>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 4)</h2>
<p>“Lieutenant Lewis, we need to know where the <em>Sunriser</em> has gone. Can you run a scan for traces of hyperspace distortions?” Captain Donaldson asked the helmsman.</p>
<p>“I'll get on it immediately,” Lieutenant Lewis replied.</p>
<p>The three Federation starships came out of hyperspace close by.</p>
<p>“Incoming communication, Captain,” Ensign Tremane said.</p>
<p>“On screen,” the captain said, standing and looking towards the main display screen. The beaked face of a bird-like Aganar appeared. The Aganars were one of the major interstellar species who had signed the original Treaty of Junction, taking part in the formation of the Federation of Worlds over a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The feathery humanoid spoke with a scratchy, lilting accent, “<em>With greetings I address you, humans. I am Captain Slirnok of the medical evacuation vessel F.S.S. Glagnar. What would be the nature of this emergency?</em>”</p>
<p>“There are around eighty humans aboard Pegasi Station, in a very sickly state. Their condition is only temporary, and they should already be on the road to recovery by now,” the captain explained. “They were poisoned by a drug, but we are unsure as to how it happened. I'm afraid our investigation into the matter was interrupted.”</p>
<p>“<em>I understand, human. We will bring them aboard, and aid in their recovery. I shall arrange for the station to be investigated for possible contamination. Do not fear, human, this situation is under control. Glagnar out.</em>” The Aganar cut off communications, and the other ship drew closer to the space station.</p>
<p>More communications came in, from the two cruisers. Captain Donaldson quickly explained the situation to them, and their captains placed themselves under his command.</p>
<p>“Have you detected a probable heading yet, Lieutenant?” Captain Donaldson asked his helmsman.</p>
<p>“I've picked up three hyperspace distortion trails. One of them was when we headed out of here four hours ago. The other two are unknown. Logic would suggest the <em>Sunriser</em> left one of those trails<em> </em>as it fled from here. The first trail has a stronger signature than the second one, implying it passed here more recently. All readings are growing pretty faint – I'm surprised our trail was still visible.”</p>
<p>“So... which trail do we follow?” Captain Donaldson asked himself softly, sitting down again, and watching the slowly spinning space station on the main display screen.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet, Ensign,” he said to the communications officer. “This is <em>Ulysses</em>: We have detected two hyperspace distortion trails. One of them should be the <em>Sunriser</em>. The other is an unknown ship – perhaps an automated freighter passing through the region.”</p>
<ul><li>“We're going after the first one, it left a stronger distortion trail. Both of you, enter formation, and follow our heading.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s18.html">(Turn to Section 18)</a></li><li>“We're going after the first trail. One of you will come with us, the other will follow the second trail. Whoever finds the <em>Sunriser</em> first, contact the rest so we can move in on her together.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s117.html">(Turn to Section 117)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 5)</h2>
<p>The commander pressed a few buttons, which all beeped loudly, but nothing happened. Then there was a sound, like the locking mechanism trying to open, but the hatch remained shut.</p>
<p>“Maybe someone on the other side locked the door?” Gregari suggested.</p>
<p>“It could be a system malfunction,” Doctor Anderson said. “If there are dying people on the other side, we've got to get through!”</p>
<ul><li>“Counsellor, can you sense anything on the other side of the door?” Carlson asked the Vesarian empath. <a class="turnToSection" href="s143.html">(Turn to Section 143)</a></li><li>“Well, if it's a hatch malfunction, we can find out easily enough.” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Lieutenant Gregari, see if you can access station diagnostics from one of the consoles around here.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s102.html">(Turn to Section 102)</a></li><li>“I guess we could try and shoot our way through,” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s88.html">(Turn to Section 88)</a></li><li>“Maybe we can find something in this part of the space station that can help us get through? Why don't we look around here some more,” the counsellor suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s62.html">(Turn to Section 62)</a></li><li>“Hey, there's a Detpack on my utility belt. Maybe I could use it to blow a hole in the hatch?” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s138.html">(Turn to Section 138)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 6)</h2>
<p>They waited while the <em>Vontarres</em> travelled around the shortest edges of the nebula, aiming for the opposite side to where the hyperspace distortion trail entered the cloud.</p>
<p>An hour later, the captain of the <em>Vontarres </em>hailed them, “<em>Vontarres to Ulysses: We have performed a wide area sensor sweep, but have found no traces of any ships having passed through this region. Either they left the nebula in a different direction, or they're hiding somewhere inside the cloud.</em>”</p>
<p>The captain replied, “We read you, <em>Vontarres</em>. Plot an intercept course. We'll come in from this side, following the distortion trail's heading, and with a bit of luck, we'll catch the <em>Sunriser</em> between us.”</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> headed into the nebula, the other cruiser following just behind her on the starboard side. As they entered the outer limits of the cloud, they saw flashes of flickering light in the distance, as charged energy built up and dissipated like horizontal lightning strikes.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet,” the captain said, and Ensign Tremane pressed some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: All ships, go to yellow alert,” he ordered, and numerous non-essential functions aboard the ship deactivated to give added power to weapons, sensors and shields.</p>
<p>They could all feel vibrations in the deck, as the ship shivered. Then minor static began to interfere with the main display screen, the scene before them cutting on and off from time to time.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Lewis turned to face the captain, “We've lost long-range sensors. Switching to short-range.”</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson nodded his head calmly. <em>Any minute now</em>, he thought.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Lewis continued, “The nebula is affecting our energy shields. They're all but useless.”</p>
<p>Now, the captain thought to himself, their ships were fully exposed should combat take place. Luckily for them, the <em>Sunriser</em> would be just as exposed if she were hiding in the nebula cloud.</p>
<p>“If the <em>Sunriser's </em>in here, we're going to have one hell of a time trying to find her,” Blake said.</p>

<h2>(Section &ndash; 7)</h2>
<p>"Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: This is Commander Carlson, we've got some bad news. Coming up to the Control Centre we've found the non-human officers of the space station. They're all dead," Carlson spoke into the microphone built into his environmental suit's helmet.</p>
<p><em>"What in blazes happened?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"We've found traces of the same dangerous medicinal drug in their bloodstreams. It seems that to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians, the chemical compound is lethal," Carlson explained.</p>
<p class="P12">"So the other eighty or so residents of the space station..."</p>
<p>"Are presumably dead as well, Captain."</p>
<p><em>"What the- where did they come from? Lieutenant Lewis, identify that incoming vessel,"</em> the Task Group heard Captain Donaldson speaking to the starship's helmsman. There was a short pause.</p>
<p><em>"Sir, it's the Sunriser - a Cassian navy cruiser,"</em> they heard Lieutenant Lewis reply.</p>
<p><em>"A navy cruiser? What's it doing out here? This isn't a military zone... Commander Carlson, I'll have to get back to you, I've got my hands full up here. Find out how that drug got into everyone's bloodstreams - we may need that information quite soon. Ulysses out,"</em> the captain signed off.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Gregari, have you found any signs of contamination in the water supply?" Carlson asked over his wristcom.</p>
<p>"No sir, it looks like someone may have tampered with the control systems down here," Gregari replied.</p>
<p>"Okay. Look, we may be on a tighter schedule. Did you hear the captain just now?" Carlson asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes, I heard everything. I'll be there in a moment - I should have more luck on the environmental control console up there," Gregari said.</p>
<ul><li>“Let's check the command consoles while we're waiting for Gregari, and see if these people left any log entries of their final hours,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s139.html">(Turn to Section 139)</a></li><li>“Come on, Gregari. We need you to scan the water supply – right now,” the commander spoke over his wristcom, as they waited for Gregari to arrive. <a class="turnToSection" href="s106.html">(Turn to Section 106)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 8)</h2>
<p>The guard went for his gun. Carlson quickly shot him in the leg. The guard fell to the floor with a painful cry, his blaster rattling across the deck.</p>
<p>“I told you not to move,” he said, as the guard clutched his wounded leg. “How about you open the cell door, or do I have to shoot you again?”</p>
<p>This time, the guard obeyed him, and used a remote trigger switch on his belt to open the cell door. The Task Group quickly set about binding the two Cassians, and Lieutenant Gregari picked up the other weapon.</p>
<p>“Now what?” Doctor Anderson asked.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door to the cellblock slid open, and a Cassian wearing a doctor's uniform came in with a tray of medications. Seeing the prisoners outside of the cell, he dropped the tray in his surprise, pills scattering across the floor.</p>
<p>“Don't move!” Carlson ordered, and the Cassian doctor raised his paws above his head. “Listen carefully, and we won't have to hurt you.”</p>
<ul><li>“Why did your ship poison Pegasi Station? Why make people think we humans were developing a bio-weapon to use against them?” <a class="turnToSection" href="s89.html">(Turn to Section 89)</a></li><li>“We're all allies here! We're all a part of the Federation of Worlds. Why would you try to break apart our alliance?” <a class="turnToSection" href="s123.html">(Turn to Section 123)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 9)</h2>
<p>"Computer," he addressed a wall panel, "We wish to go to the Control Centre."</p>
<p>"Destination confirmed," the station's computer replied from the wall panel, "Please follow the yellow lights."</p>
<p>Once more, the group headed off through the space station, following lights that lit up above the doorways, and eventually they stepped into a lift. The lift rode its way up through the middle of the station's central cylindrical structure, to arrive at the Control Centre at the very top of the station.</p>
<p>As they stepped out onto the deck of the Control Centre, they saw eight more bodies. These were the bodies of the non-human officers who ran the space station, having died dutifully at their posts.</p>
<ul><li>“This is not good... Doctor, Gregari, I think you better scan these bodies as well,” Carlson ordered. <a class="turnToSection" href="s64.html">(Turn to Section 64)</a></li><li>“Let's check the command consoles, and see if these people left any records of their final hours,” Carlson said, striding over to one of the large computer consoles. <a class="turnToSection" href="s120.html">(Turn to Section 120)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 10)</h2>
<p>The commander peeked out the door, looking up and down the corridor. No Cassians were to be seen – the crew were most likely at battle stations, prepared for any trouble from pursuing Federation starships. That would prove to be in the Task Group's favour, if it were true.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he gestured to the others. They moved down the corridor, Carlson leading the way.</p>
<p>“Commander,” the Vesarian counsellor said, opening her eyes, “I sense some Cassians soldiers in the vicinity. They seem to be heading toward our location!”</p>
<p>Carlson gestured to a nearby wall-screen. “Lieutenant,” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Use the ship's computer to locate the nearest escape pod on this deck of the ship.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” Gregari brought up deck plans of the <em>Sunriser</em>, and searched for the nearest pod's hatch. “Right here,” he said, pointing to the map on the display.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” the commander ordered, and they hurried down the corridor, and around a corner. Then, from behind, they heard a shout. Glancing over his shoulder, Carlson saw Cassian soldiers behind them, at the other end of the corridor. They were drawing their blasters, while one of them pointed at the escaping prisoners!</p>
<p>Carlson shouted a warning, and the team leapt aside, pressing themselves against the walls as energy bolts blasted down the corridor towards them.</p>
<p>“That way!” Gregari shouted, and pointed down one of the side passages. They rushed around the corner, while energy blasts from the soldiers' weapons exploded against a nearby wall!</p>
<p>“There it is!” Carlson pointed to the end of the passage, which ended in a large pod-hatch.</p>
<p>They reached the hatch just as the soldiers rounded the corridor. Carlson punched the large button by the pod-hatch, and the hatch began swinging open.</p>
<p>The soldiers stood, feet apart, and fired down the corridor at them. Lieutenant Gregari twisted, and fell backwards against the wall, struck in the thigh and left shoulder.</p>
<p>“Get inside!” Carlson shouted at the women, standing, arms wide, between the soldiers and the hatch, while the women helped the wounded science officer inside.</p>
<p>The soldiers fired another volley, one shot smashing into the wall above the hatch, the other hitting the commander in the side, causing him to spin, toppling through the open hatch, half into the escape pod.</p>
<p>The counsellor pulled him the whole way inside, and slapped a large button to close the hatch. They heard energy bolts impacting against the other side of the hatch as it closed, while the soldiers continued to fire after them, then suddenly, the whole pod shuddered as it launched into space!</p>
<p>“Activate the beacon!” Carlson ordered, eyes clenched in pain, and the doctor flipped a switch at the front of the escape pod. A red light began flashing, as the pod began broadcasting its automated cry for help.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 11)</h2>
<p>The young ensign pressed some buttons, then said, "Hailing the <em>Sunriser</em>. Channel open, Captain."</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson stood and addressed the main display screen. His image and words were transmitted to the other starship as he spoke, "This is Captain Donaldson, of the <em>F.S.S. Ulysses</em>. I greet you as a fellow member of the Federation of Worlds."</p>
<p>A view of the Bridge of the <em>Sunriser</em> appeared on the main display screen, zooming in on the tiger-like captain of the military cruiser. Like those aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>, the captain wore the navy-blue and gold trim of a Federation Space Services officer.</p>
<p><em>"I greet you in return, Captain Donaldson. I am named Calimbaer, captain of the F.S.S. Sunriser. I request you explain your presence at Pegasi station,"</em> the Cassian captain said, making it sound more like an order than a question.</p>
<p>“We are responding to a distress call made by the humans on this space station. Would you like me to send you the data on our findings, Captain Calimbaer?” Donaldson asked.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 12)</h2>
<p>“Counsellor?” Commander Carlson looked to the Vesarian empath.</p>
<p>She reached out and placed a hand on the Cassian doctor's shoulder, closing her eyes for a moment. “I detect no ill intentions from him. I believe he will aid us,” she said.</p>
<p>The commander nodded to the Cassian doctor, who gathered his medical supplies together, and held a small spraying device in one paw.</p>
<p>“Guards!” Doctor Thadasi called out. “Open the cell door.”</p>
<p>The two guards walked over to the cell door, and waited for the Task Group to move to the back of the cell. Then one of them opened the door.</p>
<p>As Doctor Thadasi stepped out, he dropped his tray. Instinctively, one of the guards bent over to catch it, and the doctor quickly sprayed him in the face. The guard continued to bend down, falling unconscious to the ground.</p>
<p>For a moment, the other guard did not understand what was happening, then he began reaching for his blaster. Doctor Thadasi quickly extended his arm, and sprayed directly into the second guard's face.</p>
<p>A moment later, he too, slept peacefully on the metal floor.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Doctor,” the counsellor said, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder briefly.</p>
<ul><li>“There's no time to lose, let's get out of here,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s37.html">(Turn to Section 37)</a></li><li>“Let's grab their weapons,” Carlson said, collecting the blaster from the guard he had subdued. <a class="turnToSection" href="s79.html">(Turn to Section 79)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 13)</h2>
<p>"We came straight here, Captain," Carlson replied. "I guess if these people will be okay, we should check out the rest of the space station."</p>
<p><em>"And try to find out how they became exposed to this hazardous drug,"</em> the captain ordered.</p>
<p>"Will do. Task Group out," Carlson signed off, then turned to his crewmates.</p>
<p>“Well, the humans over here will be okay. Let's go investigate the other parts of the station, and see where everyone else went to,” he said.</p>

<p>“What are they doing? The fools!” Blake growled.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser</em> had powered up its engines, and was beginning to move away! They had lost the element of surprise.</p>
<p>“Damn them! They fired too early!” Captain Donaldson cursed the eagerness of the helmsman on the other cruiser.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser</em> was still ahead of them, just inside their sensor range, and the main display screen continued to flicker and distort. However, from the speed at which the <em>Sunriser</em> was accelerating, it would not remain visible to them for long.</p>
<p>Suddenly the <em>Ulysses</em> lurched!</p>
<p>Chief Idato called the Bridge from the engineering section, “Captain, the effects of the nebula are sapping away our higher power functions. I don't think we can keep all systems running together for much longer!”</p>
<p class="Standard"></p>
<ul><li>“We can't let them get away – all ships, full power to weapons - focus on the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines!” the captain ordered. <a class="turnToSection" href="s57.html">(Turn to Section 57)</a></li><li>“We can't let them get away – all ships, pursuit course!

<h2>(Section &mdash; 15)</h2>
<p>The Cassian soldiers glanced at each other, their weapons no longer pointed at the Task Group. Then their officer spoke to Commander Carlson, "We have caught you red-handed, pink-skin - surrounded by the bodies of those you have slain! You will be tried and executed for your crimes against the Federation of Worlds! We know that your doctor made a bio-weapon that kills all non-humans! We will not let you get away with this!"</p>
<p>"I did no such thing!" Doctor Anderson said angrily, "The weapon you speak of was just a medicinal drug we were testing. The testing showed it to be a failure, and all research into the drug was cancelled - all the research was destroyed!"</p>
<p>"That is what <em>you</em> say," the Cassian officer said with a laugh, "But I'm afraid you won't be able to tell that story to Federation Command. It's hard to argue your case when you're dead! Besides, your ship is about to attack the <em>Sunriser,</em> and the <em>Sunriser</em> will have to destroy it! In self defence, of course."</p>
<p>The other Cassian soldiers laughed harshly, and the four <em>Ulysses</em> crewmates realised that they, and their ship, were being set up to take the fall for the deaths aboard the space station!</p>

<p>The three loyal Federation starships moved as fast as they could, slowed down by the effects of the cloud. The <em>Ulysses </em>and her escort moved in towards what they hoped was the <em>Sunriser</em>, while the <em>Vontarres </em>raced to intercept it from the other side. </p>
<p>After a few minutes, the main display screen began to flicker rapidly, and sensor detail became greatly diminished.</p>
<p>“We're almost running blind out here. Are you sure the sensor probe detected something at those coordinates? I don't see a thing,” Blake said from behind his security console.</p>
<p>“Hey, what's that?” Lieutenant Lewis said, pointing to one side of the main display screen. The screen fell into more visual distortions. Everyone looked at the screen, searching for anything recognisable amid the flickering image on the display.</p>
<p>For a moment it cleared again, and they all saw it. The <em>Sunriser, </em>only two thousand spatials away, and heading right for them!</p>
<p>“Open a channel, Ensign!” the captain shouted, and waited for her signal.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet – we've found her! All ships to red alert! Prepare for-” he was interrupted.</p>
<p>Three arcing streams of white energy stabbed at them from the <em>Sunriser</em>. The enemy ship's sensors were as distorted as theirs in the nebula cloud. Two of the artificial lightning bolts went wide, but one of them struck the <em>Ulysses</em> and ravaged its way across the upper hull!</p>
<p>Without shield protection, the <em>Ulysses</em> shuddered wildly under the attack, and the captain nearly fell from his command chair. Warning klaxons sounded throughout the ship.</p>
<p>“Target acquired!” Lieutenant Lewis cried from the helm.</p>
<p>“Fire, Lewis! Fire!” the captain shouted.</p>
<p>Two energy streams blasted outward from the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapon pylons. Both artificial lightning bolts curved wide, and away from the <em>Sunriser</em>,<em> </em>missing her completely.</p>
<p>“Sir, another direct hit from the <em>Sunriser</em>, and we're space dust!” Lieutenant Lewis shouted.</p>
<p>Then, six energy streams arced in at the <em>Sunriser</em> from both sides, as the other two cruisers moved into position. Half of the energy streams hit the Cassian cruiser, blasting away furiously at its unshielded hull. Moments later, the <em>Sunriser </em>listed to one side, and began to drift aimlessly.</p>
<p>“We've got her!” Lieutenant Lewis shouted, to a brief cheer from the other officers.</p>
<p>“Steady now,” Captain Donaldson said. “Our task is not complete yet. We need prisoners – High Command has questions they want answered.”</p>
<ul><li>“Ensign Tremane, hail the <em>Sunriser</em>,” he ordered, turning to the communications officer. “Let's give them a chance to surrender.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s24.html">(Turn to Section 24)</a></li><li>The captain thought for a moment, then turned to the Vesarian counsellor, “Before we do anything else, I would be interested in knowing what you sense aboard their ship.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s71.html">(Turn to Section 71)</a></li></ul>

<p><strong>Bridge of the F.S.S. Ulysses</strong></p>
<p>“Captain, there she is – Pegasi Station,” Navigator Hobb said, bringing up an image on the main display screen.</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson leaned forward in his command chair, which was positioned at the back of the Bridge on a slightly raised platform. The position allowed him to look out over the heads of the Bridge crew and their consoles, with a clear view of the large screen.</p>
<p>On the screen, a slowly spinning object lay ahead of them amid a spray of stars: Pegasi Station. The space station was shaped like two large discs, with a cylindrical structure sandwiched between them. </p>
<p>On older human stations, the discs would have been rotating wheels that generated gravitational force for the inhabitants. However, over the last hundred years, other species, such as the Nebulons, had introduced many new technologies to humanity – a key addition being the generation of artificial gravity.</p>
<p>Pegasi Station was one such mixed-technology space station, with a large antimatter reactor that provided power for artificial gravity across all station decks. </p>
<ul><li>“So, that's Pegasi Station.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 18)</h2>
<p>The two military cruisers moved into formation as the <em>Ulysses</em> moved out, following after the first hyperspace distortion trail at full speed. Captain Donaldson watched the large expanse of stars on the main display screen, and hoped they had made the right decision. There could be no turning back to follow the other trail, it would have faded away.</p>
<p>He also noticed a smudge of colour directly ahead of them, which began to grow larger as they travelled.</p>
<p>“Ensign Hob, what lies ahead of us on the star charts?” he asked the young navigator.</p>
<p>The ensign navigated through the ship's database on his console, then turned to look up at the captain, “Sir, it's Magniir 517, a small class six nebula.”</p>
<p>“Class six... is our heading going to pass through the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“It looks that way, sir. Class six means running slow - and without shields.”</p>
<p>“I'm aware of that, Ensign,” the captain said.</p>
<p>After another two hours, the nebula loomed large before them.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Lewis, does the distortion trail we're following continue on this heading, into the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the helmsman replied.</p>
<p>“Then we're going in. It could be a good place to hide, and I'm sure Captain Calimbaer would think the same thing. If we're lucky, the <em>Sunriser</em> is parked somewhere in there.”</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 20)</h2>
<p><strong>The Bridge of the Ulysses</strong></p>
<p>Captain Donaldson sat in his command chair, reviewing the prisoner and casualty lists on a small screen display. Carlson, Blake, and Idato had performed their duties admirably, with limited resources, and he was proud of them all.</p>
<p>He looked at one of the names on the screen. Captain Calimbaer's name was red – he had not survived. When a security force from the <em>Vontarres</em> teleported to the Bridge of the <em>Sunriser</em>, a final battle had ensued, and Calimbaer had been shot in the blaster fire.</p>
<p>His loss was a shame, for Calimbaer could have provided many answers. However, the prisoners that had been taken had already provided plenty of information for Federation Intelligence to ponder over.</p>
<p>It seemed that the <em>Sunriser</em> crew belonged to a newly emerging faction on the Cassian home world of Cassaias. They called themselves 'Purebloods', and claimed their lineage ran back to the kings of old on their home world.</p>
<p>This new Pureblood faction had Captain Donaldson worried. Their core belief was simple. They believed they were better than everyone else.</p>
<p>They believed that years of peace under the Federation of Worlds had sapped their hunter strength, and natural instincts, and it was time to return to the conquering path of their ancient ancestors. They did not wish to rule over the other species of the galaxy for power or riches - they simply believed it was their birthright to rule, that they were the only species capable of the strength and wisdom required to rule the galaxy.</p>
<p>There was no way of knowing how deep the roots of this new faction ran among the Cassian population, and that would be enough to get High Command worried. Who was to know how many other Federation starships, crewed by Cassians, would turn upon their allies, attacking under a Pureblood banner?</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Lewis, plot a course for Starbase 14,” Captain Donaldson ordered. “Our mission here is over, but I think the danger to the Federation of Worlds is just beginning...”</p>
<p><strong>Mission Successful.</strong></p>
<p>Well done! You achieved all mission goals! You found out what was going on at Pegasi Station, you discovered what the <em>Sunriser</em> had done, and you uncovered news of a new militant faction that could threaten the entire Federation!</p>
<p>Your mission ends here.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 21)</h2>
<p>"Aye, sir," Gregari said shakily, pulling out his science scanner. Doctor Anderson pulled out her medical scanner, and the two of them got to work examining the eight corpses. There were no humans here, but there were a number of short, stocky Buvus, two feline Cassians, and the corpse of a Vesarian. It only took a brief scan of the bodies to confirm the fear growing in Susan's mind.</p>
<p>"Commander, they all have Bihosanzamene in their systems, just like the ill humans," she told him. "But the drug was never tested outside of Earth! It appears that while the drug has temporary harmful affects on humans that ingest it, the substance is quite fatal to alien physiology. These Buvus, the two Cassians over there, and that Vesarian officer have reacted to the drug as though lethally poisoned by it."</p>
<p>"That's why I could not detect any other life signs!" Counsellor Lontira said, visibly appalled. "Everyone else on this space station, all the non-human residents are dead!"</p>
<p>"How did this happen? Who would do such a monstrous thing?" Gregari asked angrily.</p>
<p>“I better tell the captain what we've found here,” Carlson said, pressing a button on his wristcom.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 22)</h2>
<p>The <em>Ulysses </em>and its escorting cruiser opened fire upon the enemy vessel, particle cannon streams blasting across the Cassian cruiser's hull. Plating buckled and warped under the assault, and the starship began turning, powering up its weapons in a last ditch attack.</p>
<p>However, with horror, Captain Donaldson realised that it was not targeting them – it was targeting the escape pod containing his missing crew!</p>
<p>“Chief Idato! Teleport our people out of that escape pod!” he shouted into the ship's communication channel.</p>
<p>Everyone on the Bridge gasped, as three particle cannon blasts arced out from the <em>Sunriser </em>toward the tiny escape pod. Only one of the blasts hit, but that was all it took. One moment the escape pod was slowly tumbling through the nebula cloud, the next it – and their companions – were vaporised!</p>
<p>A moment later, explosions triggered throughout the damaged enemy starship, fire venting into space through holes in the hull. The <em>Sunriser</em> exploded outwards with such force that the loyal Federation starship shook from the shockwaves.</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson clung to the arms of his command chair, as the <em>Ulysses</em> shook. The <em>Sunriser </em>was gone, but so were members of his crew – including his close friend and first officer, Commander Evan Carlson.</p>
<p>“We will forever remember your sacrifice,” he vowed softly to his friend's spirit.</p>
<p>They floated amid the nebula cloud, lost in thought for a few minutes, then the captain addressed his officers, “Today we destroyed enemies of the Federation of Worlds. Our friends died with them – but not before they revealed to us a new menace to the Federation: a faction among the Cassians calling themselves the Purebloods, who seek to pull the Federation apart. Ensign Hobb, set our course for Starbase 14, High Command is waiting for word of our success – and we must tell them what our friends died in telling us.”</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> and its escorts changed heading, and began the slow crawl out of the nebula, knowing that a new threat to the Federation had arose, one that would attack it from within. However, their secret was out, and with this information, the Federation could prepare for any further attacks that might come.</p>
<p><strong>Mission End.</strong></p>
<p>You have achieved a Partial Victory. You learned that a faction called the Purebloods had grown among the Cassians, that they had poisoned the space station in an attempt to blame humans, and trigger a war. However, you were unable to recover your missing crew, who died tragically at the end of your adventures.</p>
<p>Your mission ends here.</p>

<p>"Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: This is Commander Carlson, we've got some bad news. All the non-human residents of the station, even the officers of the space station - they're all dead," Carlson spoke into the microphone built into his environmental suit's helmet.</p>
<p><em>"What in blazes happened?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"We've found traces of the same dangerous medicinal drug in their bloodstreams. It seems that to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians, the chemical compound is lethal," Carlson explained.</p>
<p><em>"I thought you said the drug was not lethal, Doctor Anderson?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"It seems that it is a toxic poison to non-human species. I just don't understand how anyone could have gotten hold of the Bihosanzamene formula, let alone why they would expose an entire space station to it!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p><em>"What the- where did they come from? Lieutenant Lewis, identify that incoming vessel,"</em> the Task Group heard Captain Donaldson speaking to the starship's helmsman. There was a short pause.</p>
<p><em>"Sir, it's the Sunriser - a Cassian navy cruiser,"</em> they heard Lieutenant Lewis reply.</p>
<p><em>"A navy vessel? What's it doing out here? This isn't a military zone? Commander Carlson, I'll have to get back to you, I've got my hands full here. Find out how this drug got into everyone's bloodstream - we may need that information quite soon. Ulysses out,"</em> the captain signed off.</p>

<p>“Sir, I've opened a channel to the <em>Sunriser</em>,” Ensign Tremane said.</p>
<p>The captain stood and addressed the main display screen – though an image from the <em>Sunriser's</em> Bridge had yet to be seen.</p>
<p>“This is Captain Donaldson of the <em>F.S.S. Ulysses</em>. Are you prepared to discuss the terms for your surrender?”</p>
<p>They waited for a while, but there was no response.</p>
<p>“I repeat: Captain Calimbaer, are you prepared to discuss the terms of your surrender?”</p>
<p>Still, there was no response.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Lewis turned to face the captain. “Perhaps they took more damage than we thought, sir?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps...” the captain said, considering his options.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet, Ensign,” he ordered, and waited for the communication channel to open.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: Assemble security Task Groups to teleport aboard the <em>Sunriser</em>. We need to take control, and retrieve some prisoners. High Command has some questions that need answers.”</p>
<p>He turned to his officers, “Carlson, Blake, grab some security officers. You're going aboard. I want the ship under our control, and if you can, Calimbaer would be a worthy prize to deliver to Admiral Branson. Actually, you might want to take Chief Idato with you to assess the damage over there. Some repairs may be required if we're going to sail that ship back to Starbase 14, and I doubt the Cassian engineers will offer their assistance to you.”</p>
<p>Commander Carlson gestured to the security chief, and they left the Bridge to assemble a boarding party.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 25)</h2>
<p>Commander Evan Carlson awoke with a pounding head, to find himself in a cell. The slight vibrations in the floor told him he was aboard a starship.</p>
<p>Looking around, he saw Lieutenant Gregari, Counsellor Lontira, and Doctor Anderson sitting on their own bunks in the cell. The doctor and counsellor had bandages wrapped around their waists.</p>
<p>“Situation report, Lieutenant,” Carlson ordered groggily, as he sat up on his bunk.</p>
<p>“We're aboard the <em>Sunriser</em>, Commander,” the science officer told him. “The women were shot during our skirmish back at the station, but Cassian doctors fixed them up pretty good. Luckily, the energy bolts they were hit with missed any vital organs, so they should recover fine. I guess we're prisoners.”</p>
<p>“Or hostages,” the doctor added. “The crew of this starship obviously show no loyalty any more to the Federation of Worlds. They've gone renegade. I suppose they took us, since we found that ID card number, to ensure Captain Donaldson never found out who it belonged to.”</p>
<p>“I don't know,” the commander said. “Renegades might perform all sorts of acts of piracy, but this ship was trying to blame humans for the poisoning and deaths aboard the station. They were trying to start a war. There must be something more than simple renegade actions taking place here. The <em>Sunriser</em> must be getting orders from someone else – someone powerful enough to start a war, and break apart the Federation.”</p>
<p>“Why would anyone want to break apart the Federation?” Lieutenant Gregari asked. “Especially the crew of a Cassian starship? I mean, the Cassians were members of the Federation before Earth even signed up, so why would any of them want out now?”</p>
<p>The commander shrugged, “I don't know. Still, Federation High Command needs to know the ID card number of the saboteur, so they can prove who poisoned the station. That will clear the doctor's good name, and with any luck, prove the <em>Sunriser's</em> complicity in the crime. We need to find a way to escape, or transmit the ID card's number and an explanation of what has happened to the nearest Starbase.”</p>
<ul><li>“I think we should wait and see what happens. Perhaps one of the crewmembers will tell us something by accident?

<h2>(Section &mdash; 26)</h2>
<p>As the <em>Sunriser</em> prepared to strike out with its particle cannons, the <em>Ulysses</em> blurred, and launched into hyperspace!</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> made for Starbase 14 at full speed. Long-range sensors showed that the <em>Sunriser</em> had not given chase. Captain Donaldson knew that the <em>Ulysses </em>was no match for a fully armed military cruiser, and he feared for the lives of the humans who were still lying sick in the starboard disc section of the space station – not to mention the Task Group he had been forced to leave behind!</p>
<p>“Ensign, open a channel to Admiral Branson at Starbase 14,” Captain Donaldson ordered, and Ensign Tremane pressed some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>“This is Captain Donaldson. I'll make this quick. While investigating Pegasi Station, we found that the residents had been poisoned by an Earth drug that never even went into production because of its harmful side effects. All of the non-human residents of the station died after being exposed to the this substance, but it would seem that the drug was not lethal to humans, and they are expected to recover fully within a starday. We are uncertain as to how the formula for a cancelled medical experiment could have resurfaced way out here.”</p>
<p>The admiral looked quite shocked by this revelation, but the captain continued, “Shortly after, the <em>F.S.S. Sunriser</em> arrived at the scene, and attempted to interfere with our investigation. Our Task Group was aboard the station, identifying exactly how people had been exposed to the drug, and who was responsible – when the <em>Sunriser</em> imposed a communication jam on the station. As we tried to contact and retrieve our Task Group, the <em>Sunriser</em> turned and prepared to fire upon us!”</p>
<p>The admiral looked gravely at the captain,<em> “Jeffrey, you do understand the implications of what you are saying? The Cassians have been a key member of the Federation of Worlds since before Earth even joined!”</em></p>
<p>“I understand fully, Admiral, but we were forced to retreat<em> </em>from the station. I understand that aggressive actions against my people are one thing, and accusing the <em>Sunriser</em> of poisoning Pegasi Station, and even killing some of their own people, is a different matter. I'll need some fire support if I'm to go back there, find my people, and get some answers.”</p>
<p><em>“All right, Jeffrey,”</em> the admiral said. <em>“Yesterday, when we suspected a bio-weapon was being tested, we redirected two Federation cruisers and a medical evacuation vessel to join you at Pegasi Station. They should arrive there in another couple hours. Your orders are to return to Pegasi Station, join up with the cruisers, and apprehend the Sunriser. If they were involved in this incident, we cannot allow them to endanger anyone else – killing those at Pegasi Station may have only been the beginning for them. I'm sorry about your missing people, but finding the Sunriser must be your first priority. If you find your people have been taken hostage, you have permission to use whatever force necessary to retrieve them – but we must know the truth behind what has taken place!”</em></p>
<p>“Orders received and understood, Admiral. <em>Ulysses</em> out,” Captain Donaldson said, and Ensign Tremane closed the channel.</p>
<p>Turning to address his Bridge officers, he said, “It would seem our mission here is not over. We must apprehend Captain Calimbaer and his crew, and find proof one way or another of their involvement in the deaths at Pegasi Station. If our people are still alive, they will be depending on us to rescue them. I know that you are all up to the task, so let's get this job done!”</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> reversed course, and returned toward Pegasi Station. Long-range sensors soon showed the other three Federation starships homing in on the station, and more notably, the absence of the <em>Sunriser</em>. The renegade Cassian cruiser had fled the scene, probably suspecting that the <em>Ulysses</em> had contacted the nearest Starbase by then, and their plans for the station could no longer succeed.</p>
<ul><li>“First things first,” the captain said, “Blake, organise a team to check out the station's Control Centre, and see if you can find any signs of our missing people.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s33.html">(Turn to Section 33)</a></li><li>“Lieutenant Lewis, scan the region for hyperspace distortion trails.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 27)</h2>
<p>They waited while the <em>Vontarres</em> travelled around the shortest edges of the nebula, aiming for the opposite side to where the hyperspace distortion trail entered the cloud.</p>
<p>An hour later, the captain of the <em>Vontarres </em>hailed them, “<em>Vontarres to Ulysses: We have performed a wide area sensor sweep, but have found no traces of any ships having passed through this region. Either they left the nebula in a different direction, or they're hiding somewhere inside the cloud.</em>”</p>
<p>The captain replied, “We read you, <em>Vontarres</em>. Plot an intercept course. We'll come in from this side following the distortion trail's heading, and with a bit of luck, we'll catch the <em>Sunriser</em> between us.”</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> headed into the nebula, the escorting cruiser following just behind her on the starboard side. As they entered the outer limits of the cloud, they saw flashes of flickering light in the distance, as charged energy built up and dissipated like horizontal lightning strikes.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet,” the captain ordered, and Ensign Tremane pressed some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: All ships, go to yellow alert,” he ordered, and numerous non-essential functions aboard the ship deactivated to give added power to weapons, sensors and shields.</p>
<p>They could all feel vibrations in the deck, as the ship shivered. Then minor static began to interfere with the main display screen, the scene before them cutting on and off from time to time.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Gregari turned to face the captain, “We've lost long-range sensors. Switching to short-range.”</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson nodded his head calmly. <em>Any minute now, </em>he thought.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Lewis said from the helm, “The nebula is affecting our energy shields. Another few minutes and they will be useless.”</p>
<p>Now, the captain thought to himself, their ships were fully exposed should combat take place. Luckily for them, the <em>Sunriser</em> would be just as exposed if she were hiding in the nebula cloud.</p>
<p>“Sir, I recommend we launch a sensor probe ahead of us. If the <em>Sunriser</em> is lurking out there, the probe could reveal its position,” Blake said from behind his security console.</p>
<ul><li>Captain Donaldson nodded in agreement. “Okay, let's try to home in on their position - if they're out there...

<p>"Give me a moment," the science officer said, cycling through his hand-held scanner's modes. "There are four life signs up ahead of us... through that door on the right. They must be close to death, the signs are faint."</p>
<p>"Okay, let's see what condition they are in. Hopefully Susan's suspicions will be proved true, and she'll know what is wrong with them," Carlson said, and they headed for the door.</p>
<p>Entering the room, the commander saw four very sick humans. There was a little boy, curled up on the floor in one corner, moaning softly in pain. A woman sat at a table, head down where she had blacked out. Two men were also in the room, one of them sitting unconscious at a computer console, the other one lying unconscious where he had fallen beside the console.</p>
<p>Gregari instantly went into action, using his hand-held scanner to take readings of the two men, while Doctor Anderson scanned and examined the woman and child. Commander Carlson stood back and let them work, sharing anxious glances with the Counsellor, who was doing her best to block out the pain and emotions emanating from the four victims of the mystery illness.</p>
<p>"Damn," Doctor Anderson said as she read the information on her medical scanner. "Gregari, let me look at your readings," she said, and he handed his science scanner to her.</p>
<p>"My suspicions were right. All four of these people are sick - very, very ill. However, the condition is not life-threatening for humans," she told them.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, not life-threatening?" Carlson asked, stepping closer to glance at the scanners himself. He didn't understand much of what was on the screen, for he had little medical training other than standard first aid procedures.</p>
<p>"They all have been exposed to Bihosanzamene - it's a drug they were experimenting with back on Earth," Doctor Anderson replied. "It was a failed medicine - an experiment that resulted in the banning of the substance. It was supposed to help treat solar radiation sickness, and while it did have some beneficial effects, its side effects can be seen before us. Overwhelming nausea, blackouts, dizzy spells, and vomiting - very unpleasant. However, the human body naturally resists the drug, and after a patient stops using Bihosanzamene, it goes out of their system within two days, leaving them as healthy as they were before taking the drug."</p>
<p>"Let me get this straight, Susan," Carlson said. "You're saying that these people have been drugged, or exposed to that drug in some way, but left alone, they will all be fine before too long?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. These people aren't dying, though they may feel like it. They began to fall ill twenty-six hours ago, so this time tomorrow, they'll all be okay," she said. "Few in the medical profession would know of the drug, it never went into circulation.”</p>
<p>"And this drug is what killed the aliens - sorry Counsellor - the non-humans who were up in the Control Centre?" Carlson asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. The drug was never tested outside of Earth, so no one would have known that it was fatal to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians. I can't understand how anyone got their hands on the formula to reproduce the drug," she said.</p>
<p>“I'd better report to the captain,” Carlson said.</p>

<p>“Aye, sir!” Lieutenant Gregari said, pressing buttons at his science station. There was a pulsing sound as a sensor probe fired from the front of the starship, and they watched it rocket away from them on the flickering display screen.</p>
<p>Soon, the glowing orb vanished from sight, but the science officer maintained remote contact with it. They waited as the minutes passed.</p>
<p>“Have you detected anything yet?” Captain Donaldson asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>“Nothing yet, sir.”</p>
<p>More minutes passed, and the ship rumbled as its reactor tried to compensate for the negative effects of the nebula.</p>
<p>“Sir! I'm picking up something,” the lieutenant said. “Trying to define the coordinates... There! Twelve thousand spatials to starboard-fore!”</p>
<p>“What is it? Can you identify it?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari turned to look up at the captain, “Sorry, sir. The signal has gone. I think it was the <em>Sunriser</em>.”</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet,” the captain said to Ensign Tremane.</p>
<p>“Channel open, sir.”</p>
<p>The captain thought for a moment, then spoke, “This is <em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: We have detected something twelve thousand spatials to starboard-fore. It could be the <em>Sunriser</em>. All ships, home in on that coordinate. If it is, they might have detected the probe, and Calimbaer could try to run. We can't let them get away!”</p>

<p>"Channel open, sir," Tremane said, as she pushed some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>"<em>Ulysses</em> to Task Group: What is your situation? Have you worked out how everyone was poisoned by the drug yet?" the Captain asked.</p>
<p><em>"We're running an analysis of the water supply now, sir. If it shows traces of the drug, then someone sabotaged this space station,"</em> Commander Carlson replied.</p>
<p>"Commander, we're in a bit of trouble here. The Cassian cruiser is accusing us of being responsible for the deaths aboard the space station," Captain Donaldson told him. "They say they know Doctor Anderson had been involved in the development of the dangerous Earth drug, and believe her presence here is proof of our involvement. Talks with their captain are not going well - they've ordered us to surrender."</p>
<p><em>"Sir, even if the water supply was sabotaged, we've still got to find out who actually did it!"</em> Carlson replied.</p>
<p><em>"And how did they know about the Bihosanzamene project?"</em> Doctor Anderson's voice came over the communication channel. <em>"The project was cancelled - the research destroyed. It was a failed experiment, no one should have the formula anymore!"</em></p>
<p>Suddenly, Lieutenant Lewis turned to face the Captain. "Sir! Three Cassians have just teleported aboard Pegasi Station from the cruiser!"</p>
<p>The captain's face was grim. "Did you hear that, Carlson? They're sending soldiers aboard. Your time is running out. Find out how the people on that space station were poisoned, and proof of who did it. We'll try to get you as much time as we can. <em>Ulysses</em> out."</p>

<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the F.S.S. Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>“Sir!” Ensign Tremane called out from the communication console.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Captain Donaldson asked.</p>
<p>“I've picked up a wide-broadcast communication – the signal is coming from ahead of us – it's Commander Carlson, sir!” she told him.</p>
<p>“On speaker, Ensign!” the captain stood excitedly.</p>
<p><em>“I repeat, this is Commander Evan Carlson from the F.S.S. Ulysses: We were captured by a rogue Cassian cruiser, the Sunriser. We've managed to escape from our cell! The Sunriser is part of a new militant faction that seeks to undermine and shatter the Federation of Worlds! The faction members, calling themselves 'Purebloods', were behind the deaths aboard Pegasi Station! They poisoned the water supply, and we have the ID number of the saboteur to prove it. I think you will find the person was involved with the Sunriser in some way. Please, if anyone can hear us, send Federation starships to the coordinates we are broadcasting, with all due haste! The Sunriser must be stopped!”</em> the missing commander called out from the enemy vessel.</p>
<p>“Hail the fleet,” the captain said, then addressed the navy cruisers, “<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: Our missing Task Group is still alive. If you are reading their broadcast, home in on the signal coordinates! All ships go to Red Alert!”</p>
<p>Red lights lit up around the edges of the Bridge, as every drop of spare power went into boosting ship sensors, targeting and weapon systems.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the repeating broadcast from the <em>Sunriser</em> was cut off. Obviously, the Cassians had discovered the prisoners were loose, and jammed the transmission!</p>
<p>Homing in on the last known signal coordinates; it was not long before they glimpsed the <em>Sunriser</em> on their flickering screen, their boosted sensors fighting against the effects of the nebula cloud to lock onto the enemy's position.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser</em> had also become aware of their presence, and was changing course for a swift retreat from the three Federation starships.</p>
<p>“We can't let it get too far from us now, if we lose it again, we'll never find her in this nebula cloud!” the captain said. “Chief Thomas,” he turned to Blake, “Lock particle cannons onto the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines, and fire when ready!”</p>
<p>Moments later, the twin particle cannons mounted on the Ulysses' weapon pylons fired, sending an arcing torrent of energy towards the <em>Sunriser</em> like two bolts of lightning. Their targeting systems were affected by the nebula; one of the shots went wide, but the second one lashed against the unshielded hull of the <em>Sunriser</em>, sending glowing red hull fragments into space from around the ship's engines!</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the F.S.S. Sunriser…</strong></p>
<p>Inside the <em>Sunriser</em>, the captured Task Group felt the ship shaking around them as it was attacked. They also noticed that their broadcast had been cut off from the Bridge.</p>
<p>“Someone has found us, and the Cassians know what we're up to – they're probably directing security teams to this room. I think it’s time we said goodbye to this ship,” Carlson said.</p>
<p>“What's your plan, Commander?” Doctor Anderson asked him.</p>
<p>“We're jumping in the nearest escape pod, and getting out of here, before whoever is out there blows this ship up!” Carlson said.</p>

<p>Blake gathered some of the ship's security officers together, armed with energy rifles, ready for whatever they might encounter aboard Pegasi Station.</p>
<p>They entered the Teleportation Chamber, set coordinates for the station's Control Centre, and de-materialised. An instant later, they faded back into existence, and examined their surroundings.</p>
<p>The Control Centre was much as the Task Group had found it. Dead station officers sat slumped over at their consoles, one of them lying on the floor where the Task Group had moved him out of the way so they could access his console.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the missing Task Group, however, there was dried blood on the floor, and charred markings on the walls that showed blasters and energy rifles had fired at some point. Blake crouched down beside the bloodstains, and used a device to gather samples of the blood and stream the information to the <em>Ulysses</em>' computers.</p>
<p>Pressing a button on his wristcom, he spoke to the starship, “Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: this is Blake. I've just transmitted some blood samples to the ship's computers. Someone run an analysis and find out who it belongs to.”</p>
<p>Moments later, someone replied, “<em>Ulysses to Task Group: this is Nurse Dalton. We've analysed the blood samples, and they belong to Doctor Anderson and Counsellor Lontira. Was there much blood?</em>”</p>
<p>“No,” he replied, “I think they were just wounded.”</p>
<p>He gave orders for the security team to do a quick examination of the space station, on the slim chance the Task Group was still there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>, the Bridge crew watched the medical evacuation vessel arrive at the station.</p>
<p>“Incoming communication, Captain,” Ensign Tremane said.</p>
<p>“On screen,” the captain said, standing and looking toward the main display screen. The beaked face of a bird-like Aganar appeared. The Aganars were one of the major interstellar species who had signed the original Treaty of Junction, taking part in the formation of the Federation of Worlds over a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The feathery humanoid spoke with a scratchy, lilting accent, “<em>With greetings I address you, humans. I am Captain Slirnok of the medical evacuation vessel F.S.S. Glagnar. What would be the nature of this emergency?</em>”</p>
<p>“There are around eighty humans aboard Pegasi Station, in a very sickly state. Their condition is only temporary, and they should already be beginning to recover,” the captain explained. “They should be back to full health in another twenty hours or so, and we suspect that the station has been contaminated in some way. I'm afraid we don't know how they were drugged.”</p>
<p>“<em>I understand, human. We shall bring them aboard, and aid in their recovery. I shall arrange for an investigation aboard the station to find out how this took place. Do not fear, human, this situation is under control. Glagnar out.</em>” The Aganar cut off communications, and the ship drew closer to the space station.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Lewis, we need to know where the <em>Sunriser</em> has gone. Can you run a scan for traces of hyperspace distortions?” Captain Donaldson asked the science officer.</p>
<p>“I'll get on it immediately,” Lieutenant Lewis replied.</p>
<p>More communications came in from the two Federation cruisers as they arrived. Captain Donaldson quickly explained the situation to them, and their captains placed themselves under his command.</p>
<p>“Ensign, open a channel to the Task Group,” the captain ordered, and waited for Ensign Tremane to press some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses </em>to Task Group: Blake, you haven't found any sign of our missing people?”</p>
<p>“<em>Sorry Captain. I suspect the Cassians who teleported aboard the station took them hostage,</em>” Blake replied.</p>
<p>“The <em>Sunriser's </em>trail is growing cold, so we've got to head out of here,” the captain explained. “If they took our people with them, then this is not just a capture mission, it is also a rescue operation. Bring the Task Group back to the ship.”</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after teleporting aboard, Blake walked onto the Bridge and took his place at the security console.</p>
<p>“Have you detected a probable heading yet, Lieutenant?” Captain Donaldson asked the helmsman.</p>
<p>“I've picked up three hyperspace distortion trails. One of them was when we headed out of here four hours ago. The other two are unknown. Logic would suggest the <em>Sunriser</em> left one of those trails<em> </em>as it fled from here. The first trail has a stronger signature than the second one, implying it passed here more recently. All readings are growing pretty faint – I'm surprised our trail was still visible.”</p>
<p>“So... which trail do we follow?” Captain Donaldson said to himself, sitting down again, and watching the slowly spinning space station on the main display screen.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet, Ensign,” he said to the communications officer. “This is <em>Ulysses</em>: We have detected two hyperspace distortion trails. One of them should be the <em>Sunriser</em>. The other is an unknown ship – perhaps an automated freighter passing through the region.”</p>
<ul><li>“We're going after the first one, it left a stronger distortion trail.

<p>"I was part of the team testing the drug in its early days," Doctor Anderson admitted. "When we deemed it unfit for people to use, the project was cancelled. I am uncertain as to how anyone out here could have gained access to the formula, or why anyone would expose the inhabitants of this space station to the chemical compound. "</p>
<p><em>"Yes, it is a puzzle, Doctor,"</em> the captain said. <em>“All right, Task Group. I want you to examine the station, and find out how the drug got into those people.”</em></p>

<p>“Looks like this is where we part, Captain Calimbaer! Time to pay for your crimes against Pegasi Station!” Carlson called out.</p>
<p>Then he pressed some buttons on his wristcom and spoke, “<em>Ulysses</em> Task Group to Fleet: the communication jam is down – but don't come over, the ship is set to destruct! Captain Donaldson, I believe a hasty retreat is in order!”</p>
<p>The Cassian officers began to fire hastily at the humans, who ducked for cover and hoped the <em>Ulysses </em>would teleport them out before the <em>Sunriser</em> exploded.</p>
<p>An instant later, Carlson felt a feeling like numbness wash over him, from head to toe. There was a sudden flash of white, hot light within his mind, then the Bridge of the <em>Sunriser </em>vanished, to be replaced by the interior of the Teleportation Chamber aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, on the Bridge of the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>Captain Donaldson looked at the flickering display screen. In a massive explosion, large fragments of the <em>Sunriser</em> spread out into the nebula, taking with them the answer to an important question: had the Cassian crew been merely renegades, or had they been working for some higher cause?</p>
<p>Perhaps High Command would never know the answer to that question. However, if they had not been working on their own, then there could be more enemies out there, hiding among Federation forces, waiting for the day when they, too, would strike.</p>
<p>“Ensign Hob, lay in a course for Starbase 14,” the captain ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Mission End.</strong></p>
<p>You have achieved a Partial Victory. Your Task Group found out what had happened aboard Pegasi Station. You then discovered that the crew of the <em>Sunriser</em> were responsible, and were trying to accuse humans of developing a bio-weapon to target non-human life forms. However, you were unable to find out why they were doing this, or more importantly, if they were under orders from some greater threat to the Federation of Worlds. </p>
<p>Your adventure ends here.</p>

<p>“We've got her now!” Security Chief Blake Thomas said, grinning from behind his security console.</p>
<p>The three loyal Federation starships moved in on the <em>Sunriser. </em>It was facing away from the <em>Ulysses,</em> and had yet to show any sign that it was aware of the three Federation starships.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: Don't fire until I give the command, we can't chance them getting away! <em>Vontarres</em>, move to block their path, if they should try to escape,” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>“Five thousand spatials,” Ensign Hob counted off the distance to their prey.</p>
<p>“Four-point-five thousand spatials,” he continued as minutes slowly ticked by, and the three ships drew closer to the enemy.</p>
<p>“Hold us steady, Lieutenant Lewis,” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>Suddenly an energy stream lashed out from the cruiser following the <em>Ulysses</em>, blasting through the cloud toward the <em>Sunriser</em>, but at that range, it missed completely!</p>
<p>“Damn-it!” the captain cursed the trigger-happy helmsman of the other ship. The <em>Sunriser,</em> quite aware now of their presence, began to move forwards at a steadily increasing rate.</p>
<p>As the <em>Sunriser</em> began to move out of the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapons range, it moved right into the <em>Vontarres'</em> line of fire. The <em>Sunriser</em> changed its heading, and fired streams of energy at the ship in its path!</p>
<p>Three artificial lightning bolts arced out from the Cassian cruiser, but with the nebula's effect on sensors and targeting systems, two of the energy streams flew wide of their target. The other struck the side of the <em>Vontarres</em>, blasting across the unshielded hull on its port side, sending red-hot fragments of plasteel scattering into the cloud.</p>
<p>The three Federation starships closed in, and in a concerted effort, multiple streams of artificial lightning lashed out from their ships, arcing through the nebula cloud towards the <em>Sunriser</em>...</p>
<p>Only two of the energy bolts hit their target, but without its energy shields, the <em>Sunriser</em> took a harsh beating. Hull plating blasted away into space, glowing red from the superheated energy that bored into the ship.</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson leaned back into his seat, the tension of the moment beginning to fade, as he saw the <em>Sunriser</em> tilt to one side, and begin to drift aimlessly.</p>
<p>“We've got her!” Lieutenant Lewis shouted, to a brief cheer from the other officers.</p>
<p>“Steady now,” Captain Donaldson said. “Our task is not yet completed. We need prisoners – High Command has questions they want answered.”</p>

<p>Counsellor Miva Lontira closed her eyes, focusing on the waves of emotion emanating from this section of the space station. "There are some people in that room ahead of us, on the right," she pointed the way.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's see what condition they are in. Hopefully Susan's suspicions will be proved true, and she'll know what's wrong with them," Carlson said, and they headed for the door.</p>
<p>Entering the room, the commander saw four very sick humans. There was a little boy, curled up on the floor in one corner, moaning softly in pain. A woman sat at a table, her head fallen where she had blacked out. Two men were also in the room, one of them sitting unconscious at a computer console, the other one lying unconscious where he had fallen beside the console.</p>
<p>Gregari instantly went into action, using his hand-held scanner to take readings of the two men, while Doctor Anderson scanned and examined the woman and child. Commander Carlson stood back and let them work, sharing anxious glances with the counsellor, who was doing her best to block out the pain of emotions emanating from the four victims of the mystery illness.</p>
<p>"Damn," Doctor Anderson said as she read the information on her medical scanner. "Gregari, let me look at your readings," she said, and he handed his science scanner to her.</p>
<p>"My suspicions were right. All four of these people are sick - very, very ill. However, the condition is not life-threatening for humans," she said.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, not life-threatening?" Carlson asked, stepping closer to glance at the scanners himself. He didn't understand much of what was on the screen, for he had little medical training other than standard first aid procedures.</p>
<p>"They have all been exposed to Bihosanzamene - it's a drug they were experimenting with back on Earth," Doctor Anderson reported, astounded at her find, "It was a failed medicine - an experiment that resulted in the banning of the substance, so it never went into circulation. It was supposed to help treat solar radiation sickness, and while it did have some beneficial effects, its side effects can be seen before us. Overwhelming nausea, blackouts, dizzy spells, and vomiting - very unpleasant. However, the human body naturally resists the drug, and after a patient stops using Bihosanzamene, it goes out of their system within two days, leaving them as healthy as they were before taking the drug."</p>
<p>"Let me get this straight, Susan," Carlson said. "You're saying that these people have been drugged, or exposed to that drug in some way, but left alone, they will all be fine before too long?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. These people aren't dying, though they may feel like it. They began to fall ill twenty-six hours ago, so this time tomorrow, they'll all be okay," she said.</p>
<p>"And the doctor here didn't know about this Bihosanza-whatever drug?" Carlson asked.</p>
<p>"Few in the medical profession would know of the drug," Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>"And this dangerous medicinal drug is what killed the aliens - sorry Counsellor - the non-humans who were up in the Control Centre?" Carlson asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. The drug was never tested outside of Earth, so no one would have known that it was fatal to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians. I just don't understand how anyone could have put their hands on the formula, and introduced it to this station," she said, a worried expression on her face.</p>

<p>“Our people are growing weak under the Treaty of Junction,” the doctor began. “Hundreds of years ago, we were a fierce people, a proud people who lived for the hunt! This age of peace has sapped us of our strength, dulled our hunter instincts. By forcing our home world to remove itself from the Federation and make war upon the humans and their allies, we are helping our people return to their glorious past!”</p>
<p>The Task Group members looked at each other in horror. A civilised culture wanted to return to the barbaric ages of its past?</p>

<p>“You make a good point, counsellor,” the commander said in agreement. “Let's wait a while, and see what happens.”</p>
<p>They talked softly among themselves, as the minutes passed by. Outside their cell, two tiger-faced Cassian guards stood about, a bored expression on their faces. Occasionally, they looked into the cell to see what the Task Group were doing, but mostly they ignored their prisoners.</p>
<p>Around half an hour later, they heard the security block door slide open, and another Cassian stepped into the room. It was the ship's doctor, bearing a tray of medical supplies. Unlike the harsh tiger-like features of the guards, the doctor more closely resembled a chubby lion, minus the hairy mane.</p>
<p>He called out to the guards to open the cell door, and the two guards stood by the entrance, blasters levelled at the Task Group as if daring them to try something. The cell door opened, and the doctor went inside to join them.</p>
<p>“I am Doctor Thadasi,” he introduced himself, “Chief Medical Officer aboard the <em>Sunriser</em>. I thought I would check on the ladies' wounds, though I suspect you both will have healed up quite nicely. We have very good medical facilities, even for a military cruiser.”</p>
<p>Doctor Thadasi moved over to Counsellor Lontira and began to undo the bandages around her waist. Doctor Anderson leant beside him, looking at the wound for herself.</p>
<p>“You will be fine,” the Cassian doctor told the counsellor, then turned to examine the doctor. After looking at both their healing wounds, he took two pills from his tray.</p>
<p>“These pills will help keep the pain away while it heals,” he offered the pills to the women.</p>
<p>“You don't <em>have</em> to take those,” Carlson said to them.</p>
<p>“It is okay, Commander, I sense the doctor means us no harm,” the counsellor reassured him, and swallowed one of the pills.</p>
<p>“Doctor,” the counsellor said calmly, “what is this really all about? Why is Captain Calimbaer trying to blame the humans for the deaths at Pegasi Station? It <em>could</em> start a war.”</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, I can't talk to you about such things. The captain would have me... he would not be pleased.”</p>
<ul><li>“But we are allies here, we are all members of the Federation of Worlds.

<p>“Commander,” Doctor Anderson began angrily.</p>
<p>“You have your orders, <em>Lieutenant Commander</em>,” Carlson said to her, pulling rank. Then he pressed a button on his wristcom, and spoke into the microphone in his helmet.</p>
<p>“Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: Commander Carlson speaking. Susan's suit has been breached, so there's a chance that if we're dealing with an airborne virus, she is infected already. However, there's just as good a chance that she is still uninfected. Teleport her to Quarantine, and inform me immediately if she starts showing any symptoms. Other than that, the doctor will continue to advise us over the wristcoms. Carlson out.”</p>
<p>Doctor Anderson glared at him, as her body shimmered and faded from existence, re-materialising moments later aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>Carlson pressed some other buttons on his wristcom, then spoke into his microphone again, “Doctor Anderson, can you read me?”</p>
<p>“<em>I read you, Commander,</em>” she replied frostily.</p>
<p>“I'll keep the link open, and feed our findings up to the <em>Ulysses</em>,” Carlson told her, then turned to his remaining companions.</p>
<p>“Come on, let's get in there and try to find out what's wrong with them.”</p>
<p>Carlson touched the doorpad set into the wall beside the doorframe, and the door slid open with a chime. The Task Group went inside.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 45)</h2>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> headed into the nebula, both cruisers following just behind her on either side. As they entered the outer limits of the cloud, they saw flashes of flickering light in the distance, as charged energy built up and dissipated like horizontal lightning strikes.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet,” the captain ordered, and Ensign Tremane pressed some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: All ships, go to yellow alert,” he ordered, and numerous non-essential functions aboard the ship deactivated to give added power to weapons, sensors and shields.</p>
<p>They could all feel vibrations in the deck, as the ship shivered. Then minor static began to interfere with the main display screen, the scene before them cutting on and off.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Gregari turned to face the captain, “We've lost long-range sensors. Switching to short-range.”</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson nodded his head calmly. <em>Any minute now</em>, he thought.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Lewis said from the helm, “The nebula is affecting our energy shields. They're virtually useless.”</p>
<p>Now, the captain thought to himself, each of their ships were fully exposed should combat take place. Luckily for them, the <em>Sunriser</em> would be just as exposed if she were hiding in the nebula cloud.</p>
<p>“Sir, I recommend we launch a sensor probe ahead of us. If the <em>Sunriser</em> is lurking out there, the probe could reveal its position,” Blake said from behind his security console.</p>
<ul><li>Captain Donaldson nodded in agreement. “Okay, let's try to home in on their position - if they're out there...

<h2>(Section &mdash; 46)</h2>
<p>"Okay. I think I'll look for the water supply station - someone may have fed the drug into the water supply," Gregari said.</p>
<p>"I'll try and find the Med Bay. There could be signs of the drug there. Perhaps the doctors here did know what was going on, and were experimenting illegally with the drug?" Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>"Okay. What about me, Commander?" Counsellor Lontira asked.</p>
<p>“I'm heading to the Control Centre to see if the commander here left any log entries. You can come if you want,” Carlson said.</p>

<p>“Our people are growing weak under the Treaty of Junction,” the doctor began. “Hundreds of years ago, we were a fierce people, a proud people who lived for the hunt! This age of peace has sapped us of our strength, dulled our hunter instincts. By forcing our home world to remove itself from the Federation and make war upon the humans and their allies, we are helping our people return to their glorious past!”</p>
<p>The Task Group members looked at each other in horror. A supposedly civilised culture wanted to return to the barbaric ages of its past?</p>
<p>“You, an intelligent, trained doctor of the Federation of Worlds, want to see the galaxy plunged into war?” Doctor Anderson asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Commander, I think it would be wiser to leave explosive devices in the hands of trained security specialists," Doctor Anderson said anxiously.</p>
<ul><li>“Lieutenant, I agree with the doctor,” Carlson said, “You aren't a security specialist, and I don't want you blowing us all to hell! Put that away, we'll think of something else.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s161.html">(Turn to Section 161)</a></li><li>“Okay, Lieutenant.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 49)</h2>
<p>“Okay, let's get out of here,” Blake said, clutching at his side in pain.</p>
<p>“This way,” Carlson said, looking at the deck plan on his wristcom, and pointing down another corridor.</p>
<p>They rushed around a few corners, and drew near their escape. Suddenly, they saw more Cassian soldiers coming out of passages to either side!</p>
<p>“Go!” one of the security officers shouted at Carlson, and the surviving security officers made a defensive line. Carlson, Blake and Idato rushed for the bulky hatch at the end of the corridor – the door to an escape pod.</p>
<p>Two more security officers went down in a hail of rifle fire. There were only four of them left. Blake pulled out a security device, and attached it to the keypad beside the escape pod's door. Moments later, the hatch opened, and they rushed inside.</p>
<p>“Come on!” Blake called out to the security officers, and they rushed down the corridor with enemy fire blasting all around them!</p>
<p>One of them was hit in the back, just as he climbed into the escape pod, and he fell wounded to the floor. Carlson slammed a button and the hatch swung shut. They felt the pod launch, rocketing away from the <em>Sunriser</em>, then suddenly it shook wildly, as the starship exploded behind them!</p>
<p>They were flung about the inside of the pod by the force of the shockwave, Blake and the wounded soldier crying out in pain, and then suddenly the universe shimmered around them...</p>
<p>An instant later, they were all sitting on the floor of the Teleportation Chamber aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>. The doors slid open, and Doctor Anderson rushed in with a medical team to examine them.</p>
<p>Everything was going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, on the Bridge of the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>Captain Donaldson looked at the flickering display screen. Large fragments of the <em>Sunriser</em> spread out into the nebula, taking with them the answer to an important question: had the Cassian crew been merely renegades, or had they been working for some higher cause?</p>
<p>Perhaps High Command would never know the answer to that question. However, if they had not been working on their own, then there could be more enemies out there, hiding among Federation forces, waiting for the day when they, too, would strike.</p>
<p>“Ensign Hob, lay in a course for Starbase 14,” the captain ordered.</p>
<p><strong>Mission End.</strong></p>
<p>You have achieved a Partial Victory. Your Task Group found out what had happened aboard Pegasi Station. You then discovered that the crew of the <em>Sunriser</em> was responsible, and were trying to accuse humans of developing a bio-weapon to target non-human life forms. </p>
<p>However, you were unable to find out why they were doing this, or more importantly, if they were under orders from some greater threat to the Federation of Worlds. </p>
<p>Your adventure ends here.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 50)</h2>
<p><em>“Do you, or do you not have a crew member named Susan Anderson? Is she not your Chief Medical Officer?”</em> the Cassian asked angrily.</p>
<ul><li>“Yes, Doctor Anderson is a member of my crew. Are you trying to suggest she had something to do with this tragedy?” Captain Donaldson asked. <a class="turnToSection" href="s163.html">(Turn to Section 163)</a></li><li>“Whether or not she is a part of my crew, the <em>Ulysses</em> was nearly twenty-four hours journey away from the space station at the time the people began falling sick,” the captain pointed out.<em> <a class="turnToSection" href="s153.html">(Turn to Section 153)</a></em></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 51)</h2>
<p>The commander peeked out the door, looking up and down the corridor. No Cassians were to be seen – the crew were most likely at battle stations, prepared for any trouble from pursuing Federation starships. That would prove to be in the Task Group's favour, if it were true.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he gestured to the others. They moved down the corridor, Carlson leading the way.</p>
<p>“Commander,” the Vesarian counsellor said, opening her eyes, “I sense some Cassians soldiers in the vicinity. They seem to be heading toward our location!”</p>
<p>Carlson gestured to a nearby wall-screen. “Lieutenant,” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Use the ship's computer to locate the nearest escape pod on this deck of the ship.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the lieutenant brought up deck plans of the <em>Sunriser</em>, and searched for the nearest pod's hatch. “Right here,” he said, pointing to the map on the display.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” the commander ordered, and they hurried down the corridor, and around a corner. Then, from behind, they heard a shout. Glancing over his shoulder, Carlson saw Cassian soldiers behind them, at the other end of the corridor. They were drawing their blasters, while one of them pointed at the escaping prisoners!</p>
<p>Carlson shouted a warning, and the team leapt aside, pressing themselves against the walls as energy bolts blasted down the corridor towards them.</p>
<p>“That way!” Gregari shouted, and pointed down one of the side passages. They rushed around the corner, while energy blasts from the soldiers' weapons exploded against a nearby wall!</p>
<p>“There it is!” Carlson pointed to the end of the passage, which ended in a large pod-hatch.</p>
<p>They reached the hatch just as the soldiers rounded the corridor. Carlson punched the large button by the pod-hatch, and the hatch began swinging open.</p>
<p>The soldiers stood, feet apart, and fired down the corridor at them. Gregari twisted, and fell backwards against the wall, struck in the thigh and left shoulder.</p>
<p>“Get inside!” Carlson shouted at the women, standing, arms wide, between the soldiers and the hatch, while the women helped the wounded science officer inside.</p>
<p>The soldiers fired another volley, one shot smashing into the wall above the hatch, the other hitting the commander in the side, causing him to spin, toppling through the open hatch, half into the escape pod.</p>
<p>The counsellor pulled him the whole way inside, and slapped a large button to close the hatch. They heard energy bolts impacting against the other side of the hatch as it closed, while the soldiers continued to fire after them, then suddenly, the whole pod shuddered, as it launched into space!</p>
<p>“Activate the beacon!” Carlson ordered, eyes clenched in pain, and the doctor flipped a switch at the front of the escape pod. A red light began flashing, as the pod began broadcasting its automated cry for help.</p>

<p>Counsellor Miva Lontira closed her eyes, focusing on the waves of emotion emanating from that section of the space station.</p>
<p>“There are some people in that room ahead of us, the one on the right,” she pointed the way.</p>
<p>“Okay, let's see what condition they are in. Hopefully we can work out what's wrong with them,” Carlson said, and headed towards the door.</p>
<p>“Hey, uh... Can someone double-check my suit's seals? I'd really hate to catch whatever is wiping these people out,” Gregari said anxiously.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 53)</h2>
<p>The Cassian doctor sighed, “No, war is the last thing on my mind, but this goes beyond myself, beyond this ship. There is a new faction on my home world of Cassaias, people who call for the old ways. They call themselves the Purebloods – and many can trace their bloodlines back to the kings of old! They teach us that our race is above yours, above all of the others. Our people were born to rule! Yet... my medical oath prohibits me to kill, or injure, another person, and I have stood by and let even fellow Cassians die such horrible deaths back on Pegasi Station. I just – there isn't anything I can do about it.”</p>
<p>“Stay loyal to the Federation of Worlds,” Counsellor Lontira said softly. “Regain what honour you have lost through this new faction, help us to escape this ship so that the truth can be told, and High Command can be warned!”</p>
<p>“No, I have gone too far along this path. There is no place for me back in the Federation. But... I won't stop you. I won't activate the alarm. Find a way off this ship, warn High Command of the Purebloods. This faction will do anything to shatter the peace of the Federation of Worlds, and place themselves on top.”</p>
<ul><li>“Okay,” the commander turned to his companions, “There's no time to waste. Let's find an escape pod, and get off this ship. We can activate the homing beacon to attract the nearest Federation starships!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s10.html">(Turn to Section 10)</a></li><li>“Okay,” the commander said, “We could break into someone's room, and use the ship's communications system to send a message to any nearby Federation starships!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s65.html">(Turn to Section 65)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 54)</h2>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari fed some queries into the ship's database, and examined the results. “Sir, the station is around fifty percent human. The other half is an even mix of Vesarians, Buvus and Cassians. There doesn't seem to be any other species assigned to this space station. There should be around one hundred and forty people aboard in total.”</p>
<p>The crew had plenty of experience with Vesarians, for it was that species that humans had first encountered, over a hundred years ago. Since that time, the wise, thoughtful species had assigned counsellors to human starships, such as Miva Lontira aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>It was a counsellor's role to advise humans in their dealings with alien races. An added bonus was their natural ability to sense the emotions and intentions of others, though the strength of such empathy varied with different aliens they encountered.</p>
<p>The Cassians were a feline-looking species, with short cut, soft, brownish fur, pointy cat-like ears, and a muzzle-like jaw. Many humans referred to them as 'cat people', as Cassian facial features were similar to the various feline animals of Earth. Most Cassians seemed to take that as a compliment, having a strong natural affinity for tigers, lions and other large feline Earth-animals. It was not uncommon for Cassians to have Earth-cats as pets.</p>
<p>However, while both Cassians and humans were fellow members of the Federation of Worlds, there was not a lot of interaction between the two home worlds, due to their being on opposite sides of chartered space.</p>
<p>The Buvus were short, stocky beings, who most humans thought of as arrogant and overly blunt. They were often found in positions of bureaucratic government work, as they were extremely efficient, strictly law abiding, and nearly impossible to corrupt.</p>

<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the F.S.S. Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>“Sir!” Blake called out from his security console, where he had been analysing sensor signals for a sign of the renegade enemy vessel.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Captain Donaldson asked.</p>
<p>“A distress beacon – activated close by! An escape pod has activated deeper into the nebula!” Blake told him.</p>
<p>“An escape pod? Could it be our missing team? Did they survive Pegasi Station, and manage to escape their captors?” Donaldson mused.</p>
<p>“It could be a trap, sir – a diversion from the <em>Sunriser's</em> course,” Lieutenant Lewis said.</p>
<p>“No, with our sensors on the blink, and the effects of the nebula upon our ships, this distraction only serves to prove they are nearby. Ensign Hob, plot a course for that beacon! Ensign Tremane, open a channel to the fleet!” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>The captain waited for her to press some buttons on her communication console, then continued, “<em>Ulysses</em> to Fleet: All ships to Red Alert! An escape pod beacon has been activated within the nebula – home in on that location, we suspect the <em>Sunriser</em> is hiding nearby!”</p>
<p>Red lights lit up around the edges of the Bridge, as every drop of spare power went into boosting ship sensors, targeting and weapon systems.</p>
<p>It was not long before the Federation fleet reached the location of the escape pod – and more importantly, saw the <em>Sunriser</em> in the distance on their flickering, intermittent screens.</p>
<p>“Captain, we're getting an incoming communication from the escape pod!” Ensign Tremane called out.</p>
<p>“Put them through!” the captain ordered.</p>
<p><em>“Task Group to Ulysses: This is Commander Carlson speaking. We were captured by the renegade Cassians, but we've managed to escape aboard this pod. Sir – the Sunriser is part of a new militant faction that seeks to undermine and shatter the Federation of Worlds! This faction, calling themselves 'Purebloods', was behind the deaths aboard Pegasi Station. They poisoned the water supply, and we have the ID number of the saboteur to prove it. I think you will find that person was involved with the Sunriser in some way,”</em> the commander informed them.</p>
<p>“Hail the fleet,” the captain said, then addressed the navy cruisers, “<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: our people are safe. Target the <em>Sunriser</em> – don't let it escape!”</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser</em> had already become aware of their presence, and was changing course for a swift retreat from the three Federation starships.</p>
<p>“We can't let it get too far from us now, if we lose it again, we'll never find her in this nebula cloud!” the captain said. “Chief Thomas,” he turned to Blake, “Lock particle cannons onto the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines, and fire when ready!”</p>
<p>Moments later, the twin particle cannons mounted on the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapon pylons fired, sending an arcing torrent of energy towards the <em>Sunriser</em> like two bolts of lightning! Their targeting systems were affected by the nebula, one of the shots went wide, but the second one lashed against the unshielded hull of the <em>Sunriser</em>, sending glowing red hull fragments into space from around the ship's engines!</p>
<p>The two military cruisers also fired upon the fleeing ship, only one of their shots struck their target, wreaking more damage upon the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines. The ship shuddered under the assault, and began turning back towards the Federation starships. It was not going down without a fight.</p>

<p>"You can do that?" the doctor asked.</p>
<p>The lieutenant nodded his head enthusiastically. "It's a good chance - every hour, the space station's computer would back-up all information, in case of things like power failures, system malfunctions, or other accidents. If the culprit poisoned the station, then quickly escaped, they might have forgotten to erase the back-up files as well."</p>
<p>"Let's do it," the commander said, and they turned to face the lift - just as the lift's doors slid open!</p>
<p>Three Cassian soldiers stepped out of the lift, pointing their energy rifles at the group.</p>

<p>The three starships slowed to a halt, and the <em>Sunriser</em> began to move out of range while they began charging up all of their available power into their targeting systems and weapons.</p>
<p>Then, in a concerted effort, multiple streams of artificial lightning lashed out from their ships, arcing through the nebula cloud towards the <em>Sunriser</em>...</p>
<p>Only two of the energy bolts hit their target, but without its energy shields, the <em>Sunriser</em> took a harsh beating. Hull plating blasted away into space, glowing red from the superheated energy that bored into the ship.</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson leaned back into his seat, the tension of the moment beginning to fade, as he saw the <em>Sunriser</em> tilt to one side, and begin to drift aimlessly.</p>
<p>“We've got her!” Lieutenant Lewis shouted, to a brief cheer from the other officers.</p>

<p>“I have an idea,” the counsellor said, and walked over to the front of the cell. </p>
<p>“Excuse me,” she addressed one of the Cassian guards. “As you can plainly see, I am not a human. Your plans to blame the humans for Pegasi Station are of no interest to me. Perhaps, if I could speak to your captain, I might be able to provide information about the humans that would greatly interest him?”</p>
<p>“The captain does not wish to be disturbed at this time,” the guard growled.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps,” she suggested, “I could tell you what I know, and if you feel it important, you can inform him yourself, at a later date. Captain Calimbaer would probably look upon you most favourably, in light of what I have to say.”</p>
<p>Walking slowly over to the front of the cell, the guard looked her up and down for signs of a trap. She motioned him closer, and he stepped up to the other side of the bars.</p>
<p>Most people are aware of the physical strength of the Vesarians, despite their thin, willowy appearance. Their deceptive physical form, however, made it easy to forget. As the guard stopped just in front of her, she reached forwards, grabbing the collar of his uniform, and gave it a swift tug, smashing his head against the bars!</p>
<p>The guard fell unconscious to the deck, and Carlson leapt across to the bars, and reached for the guard's blaster. The other guard span to see what was happening, and after a moment of confusion, reached for his own blaster, but Carlson aimed first.</p>

<p>"Okay, I'm with you," the counsellor said.</p>
<p>"Good. Well, we each have our task to perform. Keep me updated on your progress," Carlson said. The others nodded, then asked the computer for directions, and set off, following their own path of coloured lights, working their way through the station.</p>
<p>"Well, that leaves you and I," the commander said to Counsellor Lontira. Turning to a wall console, he said, "Computer, we wish to go to the Control Centre."</p>
<p>"Destination confirmed," the station's computer replied. "Please follow the blue lights."</p>
<p>A blue light lit up above one of the doors, and they made their way through the space station, following the lights as they appeared. They reached a lift, and rode it to the top of the space station. The Control Centre was a dome-shaped protrusion, on top of the main cylindrical structure of the space station.</p>
<p>As the lift doors slid aside, and they stepped out onto the deck of the Control Centre, they both gasped at the sight before them. All the non-human officers of Pegasi Station were still here, at their stations. They were also very, very dead.</p>

<p>“Our people are growing weak, under the Treaty of Junction,” the doctor began. “Hundreds of years ago, we were a fierce people, a proud people who lived for the hunt! This age of peace has sapped us of our strength, dulled our hunter instincts. By forcing our home world to remove itself from the Federation and make war upon the humans and their allies, we are helping our people return to their glorious past!”</p>
<p>The Task Group members looked at each other in horror. A civilised culture wanted to return to the barbaric ages of its past?</p>
<p>“You, an intelligent, trained doctor of the Federation of Worlds, want to see the galaxy plunged into war?” Doctor Anderson asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I suppose we could look for some maintenance tools to manually override the hatch, and force it open," Carlson said.</p>
<ul><li>“Hey, if I could access the maintenance command console in the station's Control Centre, I might be able to override the locking mechanism!” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s112.html">(Turn to Section 112)</a></li><li>“There should be a maintenance room around here somewhere.

<p>The ships made their way slowly into the nebula, the <em>Vontarres </em>coming towards them from the other side of the cloud. The further they went, the worse their sensor signals became. The main display screen was almost useless, as the images became distorted, and continued to flicker on and off.</p>
<p>Then Lieutenant Lewis pointed at one side of the display screen. “Captain, I think I saw something!”</p>
<p>“Pay attention, people,” the captain said, leaning forward in his command chair, eyes glued to the screen. There was a brief flicker, and then the screen cleared – long enough for them to see the <em>Sunriser</em> about six thousand spatials to starboard-port.</p>
<p>“Ensign, open a channel to the fleet,” Captain Donaldson ordered, then waited for her signal.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: All ships to red alert! We have located the <em>Sunriser</em>, five-point-nine thousand spatials to starboard-port. All ships, home in on that location. We've got to disable her before she gets away again!”</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," Gregari said shakily, pulling out his science scanner. Doctor Anderson pulled out her medical scanner, and the two of them got to work examining the eight corpses. There were no humans here, but there were a number of short, stocky Buvus, two feline Cassians, and the corpse of a Vesarian. It only took a brief scan of the bodies to confirm the fear growing in Susan's mind.</p>
<p>"Commander, they all have Bihosanzamene in their systems, just like everyone else we've found," she told him. </p>
<p>"Damn-it! How did this happen? Who would do such a monstrous thing?" Gregari asked angrily.</p>
<p>“I had better tell the captain what we've found out here,” Carlson said, pressing a button on his wristcom.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 65)</h2>
<p>The commander peeked out the door, looking up and down the corridor. No Cassians were to be seen – the crew were most likely at battle stations, prepared for any trouble from pursuing Federation starships. That would prove to be in the Task Group's favour, if it were true.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he gestured to the others. They moved down the corridor, Carlson in the lead, watching for signs of enemy soldiers, Gregari watching the rear.</p>
<p>They examined labels on doors as they went, searching for a crewmember's quarters among the storerooms, equipment lockers, and maintenance areas. Finally, they found a room labelled “Berth 211”.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” Carlson said, tapping a button by the door. The door slid open, and they quickly slipped into the dark interior. Carlson flicked on the lights, and they looked around.</p>
<p>The Cassian crew berth was similar to any of their own quarters aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>, but stark and sparsely decorated. A few plants were placed in the corners, reminders of the jungles of the Cassian home world of Cassaias.</p>
<p>“Okay, Lieutenant, see if you can patch us into the ship's communication network,” Carlson ordered. Gregari moved to the small computer console against one wall, and began to work.</p>
<p>They waited while he worked, Carlson watching the door in case they were interrupted, and the counsellor feeling out with her senses to try and give warning if any soldiers came near the room.</p>
<p>“Commander, I've patched us into the broadcasting network. We should be able to contact anyone in the vicinity, but if anyone is monitoring ship-side communications, they will know someone is sending a message,” Gregari told him.</p>
<ul><li>“It's a big risk... Perhaps we should hop into an escape pod and jettison away from the ship. If we activate the homing beacon, we can attract the attention of any starships in this sector,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s51.html">(Turn to Section 51)</a></li><li>“It's a risk we have to take.

<p>Moments later, another torrent of energy lashed out from the military cruiser, and the <em>Ulysses</em> shook under the heavy barrage.</p>
<p>"Shields failing!" Lieutenant Lewis shouted.</p>
<p>It was the last thing Captain Donaldson ever heard. The <em>Ulysses</em> broke apart under the power of the attack, and the explosion rocked even the nearby space station with its fury.</p>
<p>Your mission has failed - the <em>Ulysses</em> has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Your adventures end here.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 67)</h2>
<p>“We've got her now!” Blake said, grinning from behind his security console.</p>
<p>The three loyal Federation starships moved in on the <em>Sunriser</em> – which was facing away from them. It seemed their quarry had not detected them.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: Don't fire until I give the command, we can't chance them getting away!” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>“Five thousand spatials,” Ensign Hob counted off the distance to their prey.</p>
<p>“Four-point-five thousand spatials,” he continued as minutes slowly ticked by, and the three ships drew closer to the enemy.</p>
<p>“Hold us steady, Lieutenant Lewis,” the captain said to the helmsman.</p>
<p>Suddenly an energy stream lashed out from one of the other cruisers, blasting through the nebula cloud at the <em>Sunriser</em>, but at that range, it missed completely!</p>

<p>"Computer," the commander spoke to a wall panel, "We wish to go to the portside disc section."</p>
<p>The station's computer replied, "Destination confirmed. Please follow the green lights."</p>
<p>Again, the Task Group walked through the empty corridors and abandoned rooms of the central section of the space station, following the guiding lights above the doorways, until they reached another round bulkhead, and another large hatch. However, this time, the hatch was open.</p>
<ul><li>“Counsellor, are you sure you can't sense anything in this part of the station?

<blockquote>Meanwhile, aboard the F.S.S. Ulysses...</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>“Sir!” Ensign Tremane called out from the communication console.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Captain Donaldson asked.</p>
<p>“I've picked up a wide-broadcast communication – the signal is coming from ahead of us – it's Commander Carlson, sir!” she told him.</p>
<p>“On speaker, Ensign!” the captain stood excitedly.</p>
<p><em>“I repeat, this is Commander Evan Carlson from the F.S.S. Ulysses: We were captured by a rogue Cassian cruiser, the Sunriser. We've managed to escape from our cell! The Sunriser is part of a new militant faction that seeks to undermine and shatter the Federation of Worlds! The faction members, who call themselves ‘Purebloods’, were behind the deaths aboard Pegasi Station! They poisoned the water supply, and we have the ID number of the saboteur to prove it. I think you will find that person was involved with the Sunriser in some way. Please, if anyone can hear us, send Federation starships to the coordinates we are broadcasting, with all due haste! The Sunriser must be stopped!”</em> the missing commander called out from the enemy vessel.</p>
<p>“Hail the fleet,” the captain said, then addressed the navy cruisers, “<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: Our missing Task Group is still alive. If you are reading their broadcast, home in on the signal coordinates! All ships, go to Red Alert!”</p>
<p>Red lights lit up around the edges of the Bridge as every drop of spare power went into boosting ship sensors, targeting and weapon systems.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the repeating broadcast from the <em>Sunriser</em> was cut off. Obviously, the Cassians had discovered the prisoners were loose, and jammed the transmission!</p>
<p>Homing in on the last known signal coordinates; it was not long before they glimpsed the <em>Sunriser</em> on their flickering screen, their boosted sensors fighting against the effects of the nebula cloud to lock onto the enemy's position.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser</em> had also become aware of their presence, and was changing course for a swift retreat from the three Federation starships.</p>
<p>“We can't let it get too far from us now, if we lose it again, we'll never find her in this nebula cloud!” the captain said. “Chief Thomas,” he turned to Blake, “Lock particle cannons onto the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines, and fire when ready!”</p>
<p>Moments later, the twin particle cannons mounted on the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapon pylons fired, sending arcing torrents of energy towards the <em>Sunriser</em> like twin bolts of lightning! Their targeting systems were affected by the nebula, one of the shots went wide, but the second one lashed against the unshielded hull of the <em>Sunriser</em>, sending glowing red hull fragments into space from around the ship's engines!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Inside the <em>Sunriser</em>, the captured Task Group felt the ship shaking around them as it was attacked. They also noticed that their broadcast had been cut off from the Bridge.</p>
<p>“Someone's found us, and the Cassians know what we're up to – they're probably directing security teams to this room. I think it's time we said goodbye to this ship,” Carlson said.</p>
<p>“What's your plan, Commander?” Doctor Anderson asked him.</p>
<p>“We're jumping in the nearest escape pod, and getting out of here, before whoever is out there blows this ship up!” Carlson said. <em><a class="turnToSection" href="s127.html">(Turn to Section 127)</a></em></p>

<p>"Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: This is Commander Carlson, we've got some bad news. Coming up to the Control Centre, we've found the non-human officers of the space station. They're all dead," Carlson said.</p>
<p><em>"What in blazes happened?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"We've found traces of the same dangerous medicinal drug in their bloodstreams. It seems that to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians, the chemical compound is lethal. I listened to the commander's Log entries - it looks like everyone was exposed to the drug, but it took a few hours before non-humans showed symptoms. Then, for them, the symptoms were accelerated until they died," Carlson explained.</p>
<p class="P12">"So the other eighty or so residents of the space station..."</p>
<p>"Are presumably dead as well, Captain."</p>
<p><em>"What the- where did they come from? Lieutenant Lewis, identify that incoming vessel,"</em> the Task Group heard Captain Donaldson speaking to the starship's helmsman. There was a short pause.</p>
<p><em>"Sir, it's the Sunriser - a Cassian navy cruiser,"</em> they heard Lieutenant Lewis reply.</p>
<p><em>"A navy vessel? What's it doing out here? This isn't a military zone? Commander Carlson, I'll have to get back to you, I've got my hands full here. Find out how this drug got into everyone's bloodstream - we may need that information quite soon. Ulysses out,"</em> the captain signed off.</p>
<p>“Commander, I can run scans on the water systems, and see if the drug is in the water supply,” Gregari suggested.</p>

<p>One of the military cruisers moved in to form up behind the <em>Ulysses</em>, while the other turned and headed off along the second fading trail.</p>
<p>“Move to hyperspace,” the captain ordered, and the <em>Ulysses</em> and its escort became two blurs, moving after the first hyperspace distortion trail at full speed. They followed the trail for two hours, before the Captain noticed a small coloured smudge growing in the distance.</p>
<p>“Ensign Hob, what lies ahead of us on the star charts?” he asked the young navigator.</p>
<p>The ensign navigated through the ship's database on his console, then turned to the captain, “Sir, it's Magniir 517, a small class six nebula.”</p>
<p>“Class six... is our heading going to pass through the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“At the moment it looks that way, sir. Class six means running slow - and without shields.”</p>
<p>“I'm aware of that, Ensign,” the captain said.</p>
<p>A short while later, they received an incoming message from the second cruiser, “<em>This is Vontarres to Ulysses: we've caught up with the starship that left the second trail. It's just an automated cargo carrier. We've set an intercept course to meet up with you. At your current heading, we should reach you in another two hours.</em>”</p>
<p>“Understood,” Captain Donaldson replied. He watched the form of the small nebula growing on the display screen before them. It loomed large by the time the other military cruiser arrived and joined their formation.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Gregari, does the distortion trail we're following continue on this heading, into the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the science officer replied.</p>
<p>“Then we're going in. It could be a good place to hide, and I'm sure Captain Calimbaer would think the same thing. If we're lucky, the <em>Sunriser</em> is parked somewhere in there.”</p>

<p>There was a little boy curled up on the floor in one corner, moaning softly in delirious pain. A woman sat at a table, slumped over the tabletop as if she were napping where she had fallen unconscious. Two men were also in the room, one of them sitting unconscious at a computer console, the other one lying where he had fallen beside the console.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari instantly went into action, using his hand-held scanner to take readings of the two men, then moving on to examine the woman and child. Commander Carlson stood back and let the science officer work, sharing anxious glances with the counsellor, who was doing her best to block out the pain and emotions emanating from the four victims of the mystery illness.</p>
<p>“There appear to be chemicals in the bloodstream – but I'm afraid my scanner cannot identify them,” Gregari said.</p>
<p>“Doctor Anderson,” Carlson spoke into his helmet's microphone, “I'm patching the lieutenant's scanner data through to the <em>Ulysses </em>computers. See if you can make any sense from it.”</p>
<p>“<em>I'll do my best, Commander,</em>” Doctor Anderson replied, as the data was streamed to the starship.</p>
<p>After a while, she called back, sounding surprised and worried, <em>“Commander – I don't understand how this is possible, but I know what those chemicals are!”</em></p>
<p>“Thank God!” Carlson said, relieved.</p>
<p><em>“Sir, it seems those people have ingested, or have been injected with a cancelled medicinal drug known as Bihosanzamene. It's not lethal to humans. It looks like they were all given a strong dose, but they'll live.”</em></p>
<p>“What the hell is Bihosan... whatever you said?” Carlson asked her.</p>
<p><em>“It's a drug they were experimenting with back on Earth,”</em> Doctor Anderson reported. <em>“It was a failed medicine – an experiment that resulted in the banning of the chemical substance. It was supposed to help treat solar radiation sickness, and while it did have some beneficial effects, its side effects can be seen before us: overwhelming nausea, blackouts, dizzy spells, vomiting – very unpleasant. However, the human body naturally resists the drug, and after a patient stops taking it, it goes fully out of their system within two days, leaving them as healthy as they were before taking the drug.”</em></p>
<p>“Let me get this straight, Susan,” Carlson said. “You're saying that these people have been drugged, or exposed to that drug in some way, but left alone they will all be fine before too long?”</p>
<p class="P12">“Exactly. These people aren't dying, though they may feel like it. They began to fall ill twenty-six hours ago, so by this time tomorrow, they will all be okay.”</p>
<p>“And the medical officers on this station didn't know about this Bihosanzamene drug?” Carlson asked.</p>
<p><em>“Few in the medical profession would know of the drug. As I said, it never went into circulation,”</em> Doctor Anderson said. <em>“Hang on a minute...”</em></p>
<p>There was a sound as the communication channel clicked off on the other end. They waited a few minutes, wondering what had interrupted her.</p>
<p>“Doctor? Doctor, are you there?” Carlson asked over his wristcom. Suddenly there was a flash of light, and the shimmering form of Doctor Anderson appeared in the room.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? I placed you under quarantine!” Carlson growled.</p>
<p>“I told the captain that there was no environmental threat to us over here, and I would be fine without a suit on,” she explained. “He said it was all right for me to teleport back over, but wants a full report on the situation. As I was saying earlier, the drug must be swallowed or injected to affect you. Touching or inhaling the chemicals has no real effect, so I'm fine without the suit.”</p>
<p>“I don't like this, but there's no point sending you back now,” Carlson said, calming down a bit. “I'd better make a report, the captain will be wondering what's happening over here.”</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 73)</h2>
<p>Twelve people materialised in an empty corridor, instantly crouching and spinning to cover all directions. Nine fully armed and armoured security officers escorted Commander Carlson, Security Chief Blake Thomas, and the Ulysses’ Chief Engineer, Terrance Idato.</p>
<p>They thought they were ready for anything.</p>
<p>They waited a minute, glancing about nervously, then the commander quickly pressed some buttons on his wristcom, and spoke to the captain.</p>
<p>“Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: We've teleported aboard the <em>Sunriser</em> to the coordinates we selected, but where are the other two teams?”</p>
<p>There was no response. Carlson and Blake looked at each other. The mission was not going according to plan.</p>
<p>“Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: Please respond,” Carlson said. There was just silence.</p>
<p>Then a voice came over the ship's speakers, it was Captain Calimbaer. “Crying to your captain will do you no good, pink-skin. I have jammed communications aboard my own vessel!”</p>
<p>“Jammed! That means the <em>Ulysses </em>can't lock onto our wristcom signals and teleport us out of here, and the other teams can't lock onto the ship and teleport aboard to help us!” Blake said.</p>
<p>The Cassian captain spoke again, “I have no plans of spending the rest of my life on a Federation prison planet, and an interrogation by Federation Intelligence would be most unpleasant. I have a better idea, and I think you are going to like it, humans.”</p>
<p>Suddenly the corridor was bathed in red light, and a klaxon began sounding throughout the ship! They realised in an instant what was taking place, though none of them had ever been in a situation like this outside of the Space Service's simulators.</p>
<p>“He's triggered the auto-destruct sequence!” Blake shouted in alarm.</p>
<p>The commander thought through the situation, and did his best to stay calm. “All right, people. We could have anywhere from ten minutes to an hour – we just don't know. The ship has a communications jam in force, so we can't teleport out of here, and no one's coming over to join us. Our mission was to take control of this vessel, and return to the <em>Ulysses </em>with some prisoners for Federation Intelligence to question. Options, people?”</p>
<ul><li>Blake answered fast, “If we can get to the Bridge, Idato might be able to use the command consoles to deactivate the destruct sequence, or at least I could hack into a control console, and turn off the communication jam, so we can teleport out of here!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s95.html">(Turn to Section 95)</a></li><li>Idato spoke up confidently, “Get me to the engineering section.

<p>Pressing a button on his wristcom, he spoke into the microphone built into his environmental suit's helmet. </p>
<p>"Task Group to <em>Ulysses:</em> Commander Carlson speaking. Captain, I've got some good news and some bad news down here."</p>
<p><em>"Out with it, Commander, we were getting worried up here,"</em> the captain's voice spoke from their wristcoms.</p>
<p>"It seems that the people aboard Pegasi Station were exposed to a banned medicinal substance. Doctor Anderson identified it in the bloodstreams of everyone we have encountered so far. The so-called mystery illness was a manifestation of the drug's side-effects," Carlson explained.</p>
<p><em>"So the good news is?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"The drug is not fatal to humans, so the humans over here are all going to be fine once the drug wears off. The doctor says another twenty-four hours should do it."</p>

<p>“<em>Captain, this is Commander Carlson,</em>” a voice came over the ship's communication channel, “<em>We're safely aboard!</em>”</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson gave a quick acknowledgement, then turned back to the scene on the flickering display screen. The <em>Sunriser</em> had turned, heading towards the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>“Sir – they're powering up their particle cannons!” Blake said from his security console.</p>
<p>“All ships, fire at will!” the captain shouted to the fleet.</p>
<p>As artificial lightning bolts lanced out from the <em>Sunriser</em>, lashing against the forward hull of the <em>Ulysses</em>, the Cassian cruiser was assaulted from all sides by concentrated torrents of energy.</p>
<p>With the shields down, due to the nebula's effect on each ship, the <em>Ulysses</em> shook hard under the assault. The <em>Sunriser</em>, however, had taken more than it could bear. Explosions rippled from inside the ship, its hull buckling as it exploded outwards, causing a massive shock wave that rocked the three loyal Federation starships.</p>
<p>When the shaking subsided, Captain Donaldson and his command crew looked at the flickering display screen, watching glowing fragments of the renegade starship drift amid the nebula cloud.</p>
<p>The captain leant back in his command chair, Commander Carlson's words echoing in his mind. The <em>Sunriser</em> had been part of a larger threat, a new cancer growing inside the Federation of Worlds. High Command urgently needed to learn of the rising Pureblood faction – so they could prepare for the possibility of other Cassian ships going rogue...</p>
<p>“Ensign Hobb, plot a course for Starbase 14,” he ordered the young navigator. The <em>Ulysses</em> and its escorting cruisers slowly made their way back out of the nebula cloud, and then headed for the Starbase at high speed.</p>
<p>You discovered what was really going on aboard Pegasi Station, and found proof that the <em>Sunriser</em> was behind the deaths there. The <em>Sunriser</em> had been part of a new faction on the Cassian home world of Cassaias that sought to fracture the Federation of Worlds and move into a position of dominance.</p>
<h3>Mission Successful.</h3>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 76)</h2>
<p>The first officer of the <em>Ulysses</em>, Commander Evan Carlson, felt something like numbness wash over him, from head to toe. There was a sudden flash of white, hot light within his mind, as every molecule in his body was separated, then in an instant, reassembled at a new location.</p>
<p>For a moment he felt confused and bewildered, then his thoughts clicked back into place. It was a familiar reaction to the teleportation process.</p>
<p>Carlson looked around the chamber into which they had teleported. They had appeared inside one of the reception areas of the space station, a chamber designed to receive visitors who had teleported aboard from their spaceships. Under usual circumstances, representatives of the station would be there to greet them. As the four crewmates looked about they saw no sign of life.</p>
<p>Lights above them shone down brightly, and from what they could see and hear, the computers and machinery of the space station seemed to be functioning fine.</p>
<p>Carlson tapped a button on his wristcom, and spoke to the ship, “Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: We've arrived in the reception chamber, but no one's here to greet us. We're going to have a look around. I'll report in when we've found out more. Carlson out.”</p>
<p>“So, what's the plan, Commander?” Doctor Anderson asked him.</p>
<ul><li>Carlson gave his orders: “Okay team, let's stick together. No wandering off on your own until we've worked out what the situation is over here.

<p>They entered the lift. Carlson, Blake and Idato stood at the rear, the security officers standing before them, rifles aimed at the door.</p>
<p>“Okay, Blake, this is your call,” Carlson said.</p>
<p>“Idato, you've got to disable the destruct sequence before this ship detonates. I'll do my best to hack the communication jam. The moment the jam is disabled, the other security teams can teleport across and help us clean up,” Blake said.</p>
<p>He addressed the security team, “Men, we'll need covering fire. Spread out, and try to keep them ducking for cover. If we can stop the ship from blowing up, one of our goals is to take some officers as prisoners. Try to disable your enemies - only kill if you have to.”</p>
<p>They braced themselves for combat, and moments later, the lift door slid open. They rushed out onto the Bridge of the Cassian cruiser, a large room nearly twice the size of the Bridge on the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>There would usually be about a dozen officers working on the Bridge, but a number of them had been injured, and parts of the room damaged, during the starship battle. One of the ceiling support beams had fallen down in the middle of the room, crushing one officer, and sparking wires and cables hung down where some access panels had blown out.</p>
<p>Racing out onto the deck, the security officers brought up their energy rifles to lay down covering fire, scattering superheated bolts of energy across the Bridge. The surviving Cassian officers ducked down behind consoles as sparks flew.</p>
<p>Carlson and Idato helped their injured security chief to one of the command consoles near the lift. Blake leant down low over it, and began to work at disabling the communication jam. Idato looked at another console beside him, and tried to hack into the self-destruct sequence program.</p>
<p>From somewhere across the Bridge, they heard Calimbaer calling out, “You fools! You will die here with us! The destruct sequence is about to end!”</p>
<p>The Cassian officers returned fire, trying to take out the human security team and one of the security officers fell to the deck, writhing in agony, a smoking hole in his side. The others ducked behind consoles and chairs, taking cover.</p>
<p>Blake ducked just in time, as a blaster bolt seared a chunk out of the console where he was working. Then the security team stood and began another volley of cover fire.</p>
<p>“Commander,” Chief Idato called out, “I've disabled the communication jam!”</p>
<p>“Blake!” Carlson shouted to the wounded officer, “How are you doing? Can you disable the self-destruct sequence, or do we teleport out of here before the ship gets blown to hell!”</p>
<ul><li>Blake examined the command console. All he needed was a bit more time, and he felt he could disable the destruct sequence. “I can do it, Commander! Just a moment longer!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s115.html">(Turn to Section 115)</a></li><li>Were they running out of time? Blake looked at the console, trying to assess the situation and their chances. “I don't know if I can disarm it in time, Commander! We should get out while we can.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s35.html">(Turn to Section 35)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 78)</h2>
<p>Doctor Anderson climbed out of her cumbersome environmental suit, and unclipped the utility belt and medical gear she had attached to it, securing them instead to her navy blue starship uniform. Carlson touched the door-pad set into the wall beside the doorframe, and it slid open with a chime. Inside the room were four very sick people.</p>
<p>There was a little boy, curled up on the floor in one corner, moaning softly in pain. A woman sat at a table, leant over upon the tabletop as if she were napping. Two men were also in the room, one of them sitting unconscious at a computer console, the other one lying unconscious where he had fallen beside the console.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari instantly went into action, using his hand-held scanner to take readings of the two men, while Doctor Anderson scanned and examined the woman and child. Commander Carlson stood back and let them work, sharing anxious glances with the counsellor, who was doing her best to block out the pain and emotions emanating from the four victims of the mystery illness.</p>
<p>"That's strange," Doctor Anderson said as she read the information on her medical scanner. "Gregari, let me look at your readings," she said, and he handed his science scanner to her.</p>
<p>"All four of these people are sick - very, very ill. However, the condition is not life-threatening," she said.</p>
<p>"What do you mean, not life-threatening?" Carlson asked, stepping closer to glance at the scanners himself. He didn't understand much of what was on the screen, for he had little medical training other than standard military first aid procedures.</p>
<p>"They have all been exposed to Bihosanzamene - it's a drug they were experimenting with back on Earth," Doctor Anderson replied, astounded at her find. "It was a failed medicine - an experiment that resulted in the banning of the chemical substance. It was supposed to help treat solar radiation sickness, and while it did have some beneficial effects, its side effects can be seen before us: overwhelming nausea, blackouts, dizzy spells, vomiting – all very unpleasant. However, the human body naturally resists the drug, and after a patient stops using Bihosanzamene, it goes out of their system within two days, leaving them as healthy as they were before taking the drug."</p>
<p>"Let me get this straight, Susan," Carlson said. "You're saying that these people have been drugged, or exposed to that drug in some way, but left alone, they will all be fine before too long?"</p>
<p>"Exactly. These people aren't dying, though they may feel like it. They began to fall ill twenty-six hours ago, so this time tomorrow, they'll all be okay," she said.</p>
<p>"And the medical officers aboard this station didn't know about this Bihosanza-whatever drug?" Carlson asked.</p>
<p>"It never went into circulation - few in the medical profession would know of the drug," Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>“I'd better make a report, the captain will be wondering what's happening over here,” Carlson said.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Gregari took the other blaster, and then turned to the commander, “So, what do we do now?”</p>
<p>“I wish you all good luck, but I'm afraid I'm far too involved in this to go with you,” Doctor Thadasi said regretfully. “All the Federation has left to offer me is a life-long sentence on a prison planet. I will not help you out of here, but I will not stop you. I will try to make sure these guards don't activate an alarm.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help, Doctor,” the counsellor said, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder. They all knew that the doctor would be killed for helping them escape.</p>
<p>Carlson addressed his team, “We need to get the attention of any Federation starships that are nearby, and warn someone about this Pureblood faction growing on the planet Cassaias. Hopefully, the I.D. Card number we found will help to prove that the <em>Sunriser</em> was responsible for the deaths at Pegasi Station in some way – and who knows how many more Cassian ships will suddenly decide to turn renegade in the months to come?”</p>
<p>“We could go for an escape pod,” Doctor Anderson said. “Jettison out into space, and activate the homing beacon. If anyone is in the vicinity they would home in on us.”</p>
<p>“-Or we could break into someone's room,” Gregari said. “I could try to access the ship's communication network, try to get us in contact with anyone who can hear us, and tell them about the Purebloods. They could locate where our signal came from, and send ships to rescue us!”</p>
<ul><li>“Okay,” the commander decided, “We're going for an escape pod.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s97.html">(Turn to Section 97)</a></li><li>“Okay,” the commander decided, “We're going to try and break into someone's quarters.

<p>“It looks like we have no choice but to pay them a visit,” Captain Donaldson said. </p>
<p>“Carlson,” he turned to Commander Evan Carlson, the ship's First Officer. “Assemble a Task Group. Pegasi Station is considered a quarantine zone – we can only assume the mysterious illness has spread throughout the station. Take every precaution, and Evan – be careful out there.”</p>
<p>Carlson turned to the counsellor, “Will you accompany me to the station? We might be able to use your empathic abilities.”</p>
<p>“I will accompany you, Commander,” she replied.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Gregari,” he turned to the science officer, “you're coming too. Grab your science scanner, and let's go.”</p>
<p>Turning to the captain, he added, “I'll collect Doctor Anderson on the way to the Teleportation Chamber.”</p>
<p>“Good luck, Commander,” the captain said, and turned gravely to look at the image of the space station upon the main display screen.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 81)</h2>
<p>The ships spread out wide, making their way slowly into the nebula cloud. The further they went, the worse their sensor signals became. The main display screen was almost useless, as the images became distorted, and continued to flicker on and off.</p>
<p>Then Lieutenant Lewis pointed at one side of the display screen. “Captain, I think I see something!”</p>
<p>“Pay attention, people,” the captain said, leaning forwards in his command chair, eyes glued to the screen. There was a brief flicker, and then the screen cleared – long enough for them to see the <em>Sunriser</em> about six thousand spatials to starboard-port.</p>
<p>“Ensign, open a channel to the fleet,” Captain Donaldson ordered, then waited for her signal.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: All ships to red alert! We have located the <em>Sunriser</em>, five-point-nine thousand spatials to starboard-port. Stand by for further instructions...”</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 82)</h2>
<p>"Sir, this section of the station is completely absent of life. There are no traces of emotion or thought here," she told him.</p>
<p>"Do you think they're all dead?" Gregari asked, uneasily.</p>
<p>"Perhaps they got scared of all the humans falling sick, and so they left the station? Maybe they fled aboard a passing ship, or something," Doctor Anderson said. She hoped the eighty or so missing inhabitants were still alive somewhere.</p>
<p>"I don't see how they could be dead," she continued, "as I told you, the drug is not lethal, and its effects wear off if someone stops taking it."</p>
<p>“Okay people, let's have a look at this area of the station. Perhaps there's a trace of where everyone went, or... what happened to them,” Carlson said.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 83)</h2>
<p>“Here goes nothing,” Doctor Anderson said, then with a degree of acting the commander would not have thought she had, she began convulsing, clutching at her chest, and crying out in pain.</p>
<p>Two Cassian guards outside the cell moved over towards the cell bars, as she threw herself to the deck. The other three crewmates stood up, and rushed to her side, in false horror.</p>
<p>“She's dying!” Carlson cried out to the tiger-faced guards. “You've got to do something! Fetch a doctor!”</p>
<p>To his surprise, the guards just laughed. One of them said, “Well, now we only have to feed <em>three</em> of you.”</p>
<p>The two guards walked back to their posts. Doctor Anderson took a moment to recover herself, then sat up. “I suppose they don't need <em>all </em>of us alive to do whatever it is they are planning next,” she said.</p>
<p>“It was worth a shot,” Gregari said, helping her stand.</p>
<p>“Well, what do we do now?” the doctor asked.</p>
<ul><li>“I think we should wait and see what happens. Perhaps one of the crewmembers will tell us something by accident? If they wanted us dead, they would have shot us all by now,” Counsellor Lontira said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s43.html">(Turn to Section 43)</a></li><li>“How about we lure a guard over to the cell, and knock him unconscious against one of the bars!

<h2>(Section &mdash; 84)</h2>
<p>"I'm certain, Commander, we're perfectly safe," she said.</p>
<p>Carlson nodded to the others, and they slowly removed their suits and placed them in a pile on the floor. They could be teleported back to the ship later, but the commander felt better knowing they were on hand just in case they needed to reclaim them for any reason.</p>
<p>"Okay, we've got a decision to make. We need to find out how that cancelled drug was administered to the humans on this station, and to find out where the non-humans went, or what happened to them," Carlson said.</p>
<p><span class="Paragraph_20_BOLD">Remember, or write down, that the Task Group has taken off their environmental suits. Then continue reading as per normal.</span></p>
<ul><li>“We're in the main section of the station, the cylindrical structure at the centre.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 85)</h2>
<p>“Okay, let's get out of here,” Chief Idato said, clutching at his side in pain.</p>
<p>“This way,” Carlson said, looking at the deck plan on his wristcom, and pointing down another corridor.</p>
<p>They rushed around a few corners, and drew near to their escape. Suddenly, they saw more Cassian soldiers coming out of passages to either side!</p>
<p>“Go!” one of the security officers shouted at Carlson, and the surviving security officers made a defensive line. Carlson, Blake and Idato rushed for the bulky hatch at the end of the corridor – the door to an escape pod.</p>
<p>Two more security officers went down in a hail of rifle fire. There were only four of them left. Blake pulled out a security device, and attached it to the keypad beside the escape pod's door. Moments later, the hatch opened, and they rushed inside.</p>
<p>“Come on!” Blake called out to the security officers, and they rushed down the corridor with enemy fire blasting all around them!</p>
<p>One of them was hit in the back, just as he climbed into the escape pod, and he fell wounded to the floor. Blake slammed a button and the hatch swung shut. They felt the pod launch, rocketing away from the <em>Sunriser</em>, then suddenly it shook wildly, as the starship exploded behind them!</p>
<p>They were flung about the inside of the pod by the force of the shock wave, Idato and the wounded soldier crying out in pain, and then suddenly the universe shimmered around them...</p>
<p>An instant later, they were all sitting on the floor of the Teleportation Chamber aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>. The doors slid open, and Doctor Anderson rushed in with a medical team to examine them.</p>
<p>Everything was going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, on the Bridge of the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>Captain Donaldson looked at the flickering display screen. Large fragments of the <em>Sunriser</em> spread out into the nebula, taking with them the answer to an important question: had the Cassian crew been merely renegades, or had they been working for some higher cause?</p>
<p>Perhaps High Command would never know the answer to that question. However, if they had not been working on their own, then there could be more enemies out there, hiding among Federation forces, waiting for the day when they, too, would strike.</p>
<p>You have achieved a Partial Victory. Your Task Group found out what had happened aboard Pegasi Station. You then discovered that the crew of the <em>Sunriser</em> was responsible, and were trying to accuse humans of developing a bio-weapon to target non-human life forms. However, you were unable to find out why they were doing this, or more importantly, if they were under orders from some greater threat to the Federation of Worlds. </p>
<p>Your adventure ends here.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 86)</h2>
<p>Suddenly they heard a sound over their wristcoms, it was the proximity alarm sounding on the Bridge of the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p><em>"Hang on, Commander,"</em> the captain said, and then spoke to someone on the Bridge.<em> "Lieutenant Lewis, what seems to be the problem?"</em></p>
<p><em>"Sir, long range sensors have picked up an incoming starship,"</em> the voice of the <em>Ulysses</em>' helmsman called out.</p>
<p><em>"Can you identify it?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, then the response, <em>"Sir, it's the Sunriser - a Cassian navy cruiser!"</em></p>
<p>"<em>A military starship?</em>" the captain sounded surprised. <em>"What's it doing out here?"</em></p>
<p>The captain addressed Carlson again, <em>"Commander, the Cassians may have called one of their own ships to aid Pegasi Station. I'm unsure as to why a military vessel and not a medical ship or multi-role vessel would show up here. I want you to find out how this cancelled Earth drug got inside everyone, and report to me as soon as possible. We may have a new situation developing here. Ulysses out."</em></p>
<p>"You heard the captain - let's get to work, people!" Carlson said to his companions.</p>
<p>“If we go back to the Control Centre, I can run scans on the water systems, and see if the drug was put into the water supply,” Gregari suggested.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 87)</h2>
<p>“Aye, engines at full power!” Chief Idato called over a communications channel. The <em>Ulysses</em> and the two cruisers began to very slowly draw nearer to the <em>Sunriser</em>.</p>
<p>Then the ships shivered again, and power levels began to drop. The <em>Sunriser</em> slowed down a fraction, then began to speed up again. The <em>Ulysses</em> and the two cruisers, however, continued to slow down.</p>
<p>The captain pressed a button on his command chair, and spoke to the engineering section, “Chief Idato – we need more speed!”</p>
<p>“Sorry Captain, higher power functions are drained. We're stuck at low speed until we can charge enough energy back up again,” the engineering chief explained.</p>
<p>“All power to weapons, target their engines – we can't let them get away!” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>“Captain, they're out of range now,” Lieutenant Lewis said from the helm.</p>
<p>Amid the display screen distortions, and the constant flickering, the Bridge crew watched the <em>Sunriser</em> disappear into the nebula cloud.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Gregari, do we still have them on sensors?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“Negative, sir. We've lost them,” he answered.</p>
<p>The captain leaned back in his chair, and thought about what he would tell the admiral. Their quarry had escaped them. At low speed, it would take a while to get out of the nebula, but even when they did, they would have no way of knowing which way the <em>Sunriser</em> had left the nebula. There would be almost no chance of finding the distortion trail the ship would leave when it leapt into hyperspace.</p>
<p>It took them over twenty-four hours to return to Starbase 14. There they discussed what had taken place in depth with Admiral Branson. High Command put out an order for all ships to attempt to capture or destroy the <em>Sunriser</em> if it was ever seen again.</p>
<p><strong>Mission End.</strong></p>
<p>You have achieved a partial victory: you worked out what was happening aboard Pegasi Station, and stopped the renegade Cassians from blaming humans for the deaths – and possible starting a war.</p>
<p>However, the Cassian representatives in the Federation of Worlds denied any involvement in the incident, and there was no way to know if the <em>Sunriser</em> had been acting on its own, or under someone else's instructions.</p>
<p>Your adventure ends here.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 88)</h2>
<p>Carlson drew his multi-mode blaster from the utility belt attached to his environmental suit.</p>
<p>“All right, people, we're probably running out of time. Everyone, set your blasters on wide spread. I'll aim for the centre, Gregari has the right, and Anderson has the left. Counsellor, aim below my shot. Hold the beam for ten, and we'll see how thick this hatch is.”</p>
<p>They drew their blasters, and each took careful aim. “Okay, fire on my mark... Mark!”</p>
<p>Four beams of energy spread out from the blasters to bathe the middle section of the hatch in superheated light. On wide spread, it was much like shining a wide-beam torch onto a wall, and the hatch glowed red where the circles of energy overlapped.</p>
<p>Soon the surface of the hatch rippled under the torrent of energy, then began melting and dripping away. Then they were through! Quickly they shut off their blasters, so they would not cause much damage on the other side of the hatch.</p>
<p>The edges of the gaping hole glowed hot and fierce. They were glad they were wearing environmental suits, because the fumes from the melted plasteel would sting their eyes and cause bouts of nausea.</p>
<p>“Looks a bit hot,” Gregari pointed out, and as if on cue, the station's emergency systems kicked in. Ice-cold gel sprayed down from nozzles in the ceiling, directed at the hatch. Soon the entire hatch surface was coated in the cold goop, and the red glow faded to a charred black and silver.</p>
<p>“Let's go, team – there are sick people in there, and we need to find a cure!” Carlson said.</p>

<p>The Cassian doctor shook nervously, “Please don't shoot me! I'm just a doctor! I'm not involved in what the officers of this ship are doing!”</p>
<p>“You say you're a doctor, and yet you allowed all those people aboard Pegasi Station to die!” Doctor Anderson accused him.</p>
<p>“Please, if I don't go along with them, Captain Calimbaer would have me killed!” the Cassian doctor said.</p>
<p>“Just answer our questions,” the commander ordered.</p>
<ul><li>Carlson waved his blaster in the doctor's face, “Starting a war against enemies is one thing, murdering innocent people – even your own people – aboard that station is something entirely different!

<p>They made their way back through the hole in the hatch, into the cylindrical centre structure of the space station. The doctor pointed out that it was much easier moving about without wearing her bulky environmental suit.</p>
<p>“Why don't you get out of those suits, they're only slowing us down, and I've established that there is no virus spreading through the air,” she said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s145.html">(Turn to Section 145)</a></p>

<p>They helped Idato to walk, and rushed through the last few bends in the corridor, then burst into the engineering section of the ship. The security officers spread out, pointing their energy rifles at the Cassian technicians scattered about the massive chamber.</p>
<p>The reactor rose in the middle of the chamber, surrounded by large pieces of machinery. Computer consoles and engineering equipment stations were scattered about.</p>
<p>The Cassian technicians had their paws raised above their heads, but looked eager to take a swipe at the security officers with their claws, and the security officers glanced from enemy to enemy, nervously shifting their grip on their energy rifles.</p>
<p>“Over there,” Idato said, pointing to a large computer console station. Blake and Carlson helped him over to it, and the engineer got down to work.</p>
<p>Over the ship's speakers, Captain Calimbaer taunted them, “You'll never do it in time, pink-skin! Only a minute or two left, and we're all history!”</p>
<p>“Come on, Idato – work your magic!” Carlson encouraged the injured man.</p>
<p>“I've re-routed secondary command systems to this console,” Idato said, as his fingers rushed across the buttons and touch-screen interfaces of the console. “Almost there!”</p>
<p>One of the technicians rushed at one of the security officers, who quickly shot at the floor in front of the charging Cassian. The technician stopped, glancing at the smoking hole, and growled – but stayed where he was.</p>
<p>“I've got it! Access to the main command systems!” Idato shouted in excitement. Suddenly, the lights throughout the ship reverted to a pale white glow. He had done it! The self-destruct sequence had been deactivated!</p>
<p>“Now for the communication jam,” he said, hacking his way into the starship's command systems. A minute later, they heard the vibrating sound of a teleportation in progress, and two-dozen security officers suddenly appeared in the chamber with them – reinforcements from the other two Federation cruisers!</p>
<p>“About time you guys showed up,” Carlson said with relief. The ship was theirs! All that was left was to round up the crew and take the officers aboard the <em>Ulysses </em>as prisoners. Captain Donaldson, and the Federation High Command would be very pleased.</p>

<p>Pressing buttons, he brought up recent log entries, looking for anything from the last twenty-six hours. There were three entries. He played the first one.</p>
<p><strong>Year 112 of the Federation, Starday 335, </strong></p>
<p><strong>Commander's Log Supplemental.</strong></p>
<blockquote>“A number of our human contingent have began showing signs of illness, and Doctor Phisanthi has no idea what might be causing this outbreak. Symptoms include dizzy spells, frequent vomiting, and retching. The Earth representative here issued a plea to a nearby Federation Starbase a moment ago, requesting they send a medical team here with all haste. He fears some dangerous virus or disease is affecting the humans here. So far, none of the other races here have been affected by this malady. It appears to be a purely human ailment, and we are saddened to see our human friends being taken ill so suddenly. Doctor Phisanthi will continue to examine the patients being brought in, trying to identify the cause of this illness, but I fear the number of sick is increasing faster than the good doctor can handle. My officers have suggested that perhaps the humans be placed in quarantine until a Federation medical team arrives.”</blockquote>
<p><strong>Year 112 of the Federation, Starday 335,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commander's Log Supplemental - B</strong></p>
<blockquote>“(Cough) (Cough) It is now sixteen hours since the humans began falling ill - and suddenly, whole departments of non-humans have fallen to the sickness as well! It would seem that the onset of this virus comes later for non-human species, and the intensity of the symptoms is far harsher. Six Buvus, eight Cassians, and two Vesarians have died in the last hour, while the humans, though nearly all of them are now quite ill, have yet to suffer any such casualties. There has been some questions among the Cassians about why the humans are not dying from this outbreak. Someone appallingly suggested that anyone who was infected be spaced, to ensure the illness would not continue to spread. Spaced! Things are starting to get out of hand here. We have still received no response from the Federation Starbase as to whether anyone is being sent to help us or not.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(Cough) (Cough) It has now been a day since the outbreak began. The humans have locked themselves in the starboard disc section of the station after some Cassians began killing off humans to, as they put it, stop the spread of the disease. It was no good though, (Cough) (Cough) I think there's not a healthy person left aboard this station. We're all dying. I don't think there's much time left. I pray someone will come soon before we're all dead. The symptoms of this condition seem to be accelerating among non-human species. The humans are all alive still, but there's only about twenty of us others left. Could the humans have engineered this virus somehow? A bio-weapon that will kill everyone but them? (Cough) (Cough) It's an appalling idea, I know, and could not be true - but many of the Cassians have begun discussing this idea. They forget that while the humans haven't dropped dead yet, they're still terribly sick. Why would someone make a weapon that did that to their own people? (Cough) (Cough) I don't think we're going to make it... But I hope someone... can still help... the humans. Some of my... best... friends... were....”</blockquote>
<p>“All right, let's head back to the hatchway. We should be able to reach the survivors and find out what is wrong with them,” Carlson said.</p>

<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> headed into the nebula, both cruisers following just behind her on either side. As they entered the outer limits of the cloud, they saw flashes of flickering light in the distance, as charged energy built up and dissipated like horizontal lightning strikes.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet,” the captain ordered, and Ensign Tremane pressed some buttons on her console.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: All ships, go to yellow alert,” he ordered, and numerous non-essential functions aboard the ship deactivated to give added power to weapons, sensors and shields.</p>
<p>They could all feel vibrations in the deck, as the ship shivered from time to time. Then minor static began to interfere with the main display screen, the scene before them cutting on and off.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Lewis turned to face the captain, “We've lost long-range sensors. Switching to short-range.”</p>
<p>Captain Donaldson nodded his head calmly. Any minute now, he thought.</p>
<p>“Sir,” Lieutenant Lewis continued, “The nebula cloud is affecting our energy shields. Another few minutes and they will be useless.”</p>
<p>Now, the captain thought to himself, each of their ships were fully exposed should combat take place. Luckily for them, the <em>Sunriser</em> would be just as exposed if she were hiding in the nebula cloud.</p>
<p>“If they're in here, it's going to be one hell of a time trying to find them,” Blake said.</p>

<p>"Sounds good," Carlson agreed. Turning to a nearby wall console, he said, "Computer, we wish to go to the water supply station."</p>
<p>"Destination confirmed, please follow the red lights," the station's computer said from the wall panel. A red light lit up above a nearby doorway, and they headed through the space station, following more lights as they appeared.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, and going down a few levels, they arrived at the station's water supply station. The chamber was large, with massive water tanks jutting out of the walls, pipes going every-which-way, and other related machinery. Near the entrance were some computer consoles used to control, maintain, and regulate the station's water supply.</p>
<p>"I'll just be a moment," Gregari said, heading over to the consoles.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, he looked back, an annoyed expression on his face. "Someone has tampered with these consoles. I can't get any information from here."</p>
<p>"Damn! What do we do now?" Carlson wondered aloud. For a moment, they all thought about what to do next, then Gregari snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>"Hey, the Control Centre on this space station should be much like the bridge on the <em>Ulysses</em>, right?" he said.</p>
<p>"Of course!" Carlson said. "They should have master command consoles, capable of performing any station functions from there - in case of an emergency."</p>
<p>"I should be able to access the environmental subsystems on one of the command consoles, let's go!" Gregari said enthusiastically, and they quickly asked the station's computer for directions, and headed off, following the lights.</p>
<p>They made their way back through the space station, going up levels, to a large lift. Then they rode the lift all the way to the top of the central cylinder structure of the space station, where the dome-like Control Centre protruded from the outer hull.</p>
<p>After the lift doors slid open, they stepped out onto the Control Centre's deck, and everyone gasped. The non-human officers of Pegasi Station were all here, seated at their posts. Each one of them was very, very dead.</p>
<ul><li>“Let's check the command consoles, and see if these people left any records of their final hours,” Carlson said, striding over to a main console. <a class="turnToSection" href="s152.html">(Turn to Section 152)</a></li><li>“This is not good... Doctor, Lieutenant Gregari, I think you had better scan these bodies now,” Carlson ordered. <a class="turnToSection" href="s21.html">(Turn to Section 21)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 95)</h2>
<p>“Good idea, let's head for the Bridge!” Carlson ordered. They cycled through the deck plans on their wristcom display screens, and headed off through the ship.</p>
<p>They soon saw the lift they needed to head up to the Bridge deck of the <em>Sunriser</em>, at the end of a long corridor – however, it would not be that easy. </p>
<p>Doors slid open ahead of them, and armoured Cassian soldiers stepped out, wielding energy rifles! The Task Group's security officers opened fire, and soon blaster bolts seared through the air in both directions.</p>
<p>Carlson, Blake and Idato pressed themselves against the corridor walls, finding partial cover behind bulkhead beams, they leaned out now and then to fire shots from their blasters.</p>
<p>With cries of pain, two of the security officers collapsed, smoke drifting up from their uniforms. Blake frowned – their numbers were thinning, but he could see that half of the Cassian soldiers had taken hits as well. Then Blake heard marching feet from behind them. Spinning around, he saw more Cassian soldiers coming from behind!</p>
<p>“Grenade!” he shouted, throwing a ship-safe explosive down the corridor, toward the second force. The Task Group members pressed themselves up against the walls as the explosive detonated, decimating the soldiers behind them!</p>
<p>Turning back to the direction they were heading, the Task Group pressed their way down the corridor, firing as they charged. Another security officer went down with two holes in his chest, but moments later, the Cassian force was defeated.</p>
<p>“I'm hit!” Blake called out. He was behind them, down the corridor, leaning hard against the wall. Dark scorch marks showed he had been shot in the thigh, and blood dripped from his forehead where shrapnel had cut him.</p>
<p>“How bad is it, Blake?” Carlson asked, going over and examining the wound.</p>
<p>“I can handle it. Get me to the Bridge,” he said bravely. “We've got to disable the destruct sequence, and I can turn off the communication jam from there – so the other teams can teleport over and help us capture the ship!”</p>
<p>Chief Idato knelt down beside the injured man, then turned to Carlson, “I might be able to disable the destruct sequence using the controls on the Bridge, but I'm not sure. Maybe we should find an escape pod, and get Blake out of here. If we take him to the bridge to turn off the jam, but he faints before we get there, then we'll all still be stuck on here when the ship blows!”</p>
<p>Blake shook his head, “We’ve got a job to do, we should do it.” Turning to the commander, he added, “But it's you're call, Carlson – this is your mission.”</p>
<ul><li>“We're going for it. Hold on, Blake. Once we take control of the Bridge and turn off the communications jam, the <em>Ulysses</em> can beam you straight to Med bay!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s77.html">(Turn to Section 77)</a></li><li>“This whole mission has gone to hell! We don't know how much time we have before the <em>Sunriser</em> blows up. I think it's time we got out of here – let's find an escape pod!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s49.html">(Turn to Section 49)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 96)</h2>
<p>The science officer drew his hand-held science scanner, and began a sensor sweep of the area beyond the hatchway.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Commander, there are no traces of life out here at all,” he said.</p>
<p>“Okay people, let's have a look at this area of the station. Perhaps there's a trace of where everyone went, or... what happened to them,” Carlson said.</p>
<p><a class="turnToSection" href="s124.html">(Turn to Section 124)</a></p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 97)</h2>
<p>The commander peeked out the door, looking up and down the corridor. No Cassians were to be seen – the crew were most likely at battle stations, prepared for any trouble from pursuing Federation starships. That would prove to be in the Task Group's favour, if it were true.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he gestured to the others. They moved down the corridor, Carlson in the lead with the blaster he had acquired, Gregari in the rear with the other blaster, in case someone came up behind them.</p>
<p>“Commander,” the Vesarian counsellor said, opening her eyes, “I sense some Cassians soldiers in the vicinity. They seem to be heading toward our location!”</p>
<p>Carlson gestured to a nearby wall-screen. “Lieutenant,” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Use the ship's computer to locate the nearest escape pod on this deck of the ship.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the lieutenant brought up deck plans of the <em>Sunriser</em>, and searched for the nearest pod's hatch. “Right here,” he said, pointing to the map on the display.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” the commander ordered, and they hurried down the corridor, and around a corner. Then, from behind, they heard a shout. Glancing over his shoulder, Carlson saw Cassian soldiers behind them, at the other end of the corridor. They were drawing their blasters, while one of them pointed at the escaping prisoners! Carlson fired a short blast in their direction, causing them to jump aside.</p>
<p>“That way!” Gregari shouted, and pointed down one of the side passages. They rushed around the corner, while energy blasts from the soldiers' weapons exploded against a nearby wall.</p>
<p>“There it is!” Carlson pointed to the end of the passage, which ended in a large pod-hatch.</p>
<p>They reached the hatch just as the soldiers rounded the corridor. Carlson and Gregari wildly fired their blasters down the corridor at the soldiers, missing both of them.</p>
<p>The soldiers, with their greater training, did not miss. Lieutenant Gregari shook, and fell backwards against the wall, struck in the thigh and one shoulder. While injured, he continued to fight, keeping his grip on his blaster, and shooting more energy bolts at the incoming soldiers.</p>
<p>“Get the hatch open!” Carlson shouted at the women, while the doctor worked at buttons beside the hatch. He crouched, taking aim, and fired a bolt directly into the chest of one of the Cassian soldiers! The soldier roared, as he was flung backwards, tumbling to the deck.</p>
<p>“It's opening!” Doctor Anderson cried out, as the hatch slid aside. The women helped the wounded science officer into the escape pod, while Carlson laid down covering fire, causing the remaining soldier to take cover behind a bulkhead.</p>
<p>“Commander, come on!” the doctor shouted, and Carlson leapt into the escape pod. Slapping a large button, he closed the hatch. They heard energy bolts impacting against the other side of the hatch as the soldier continued to fire after them, then suddenly, the whole pod shuddered, as it launched into space!</p>
<p>“Activate the beacon!” Carlson ordered, and the counsellor flipped a switch at the front of the escape pod. A red light began flashing, as the pod began broadcasting its automated cry for help.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 98)</h2>
<p>The door began to slide shut, surprising the Cassian soldiers. They began to bring their rifles up, facing the Task Group, but the door closed, and the lift began to rapidly descend!</p>
<p>"This should gain us some time," the commander said, thinking hard about what they should do next.</p>
<p>"Sir, they said the <em>Sunriser</em> was going to blow up the <em>Ulysses</em>. We need to warn them!" Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>"We also need to find out which station resident used card 7254-A," the counsellor reminded them.</p>
<p>"I think survival is more important at the moment. If we can get out of the communication jam, the ship can get a lock onto us, and we can teleport out of here. Hopefully, the <em>Ulysses</em> will have enough time to make the jump to hyperspace. When we're away from the <em>Sunriser</em>, we can send the ID number ahead of us to Starbase 14, where their employment records should be able to tell us who the saboteur was," Carlson said.</p>
<p>"That will be a help - as long as it proves a Cassian put the drug in the water supply. Then we can assume the culprit escaped aboard the <em>Sunriser</em>, and they waited for us to come here so they could set us up. But what if records show a Cassian did not poison the water?" Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>"Well, it's all we've got time for. Let's try and get out of here, and warn the ship before it gets blown to hell!" Carlson said, as the lift doors slid open, and he stepped out.</p>
<p>“Okay, we head for the nearest shuttle bay, and get the hell out of here!”</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 99)</h2>
<p>The Cassian doctor sighed, “No, war is the last thing on my mind, but this goes beyond myself, beyond this ship. There is a new faction on my home world of Cassaias, people who call for the old ways. They call themselves the Purebloods – and many can trace their bloodlines back to the kings of old! They teach us that our race is above yours, above all the others. Our people were born to rule! Yet... my medical oath prohibits me to kill, or injure, another person, and I have stood by and let even fellow Cassians die such horrible deaths back on Pegasi Station. I just – there isn't anything I can do about it.”</p>
<p>“Stay loyal to the Federation of Worlds,” Counsellor Lontira said softly. “Regain what honour you have lost through this new faction, help us to escape this ship so that the truth can be told, and High Command can be warned!”</p>
<p>“No, I have gone too far along this path. There is no place for me back in the Federation. But... I won't stop you. I won't activate the alarm. Find a way off this ship, warn High Command of the Purebloods. This faction will do anything to shatter the peace of the Federation of Worlds, and place themselves on top.”</p>
<ul><li>“Okay,” the commander turned to his companions, “There's no time to waste. Let's find an escape pod, and get off this ship. We can activate the homing beacon to attract the nearest Federation starships!”<a class="turnToSection" href="s10.html">(Turn to Section 10)</a></li><li>“Okay,” the commander turned to his companions, “We break into someone's room, and use the ship's communications system to send a message to any nearby Federation starships!” <a class="turnToSection" href="s113.html">(Turn to Section 113)</a></li></ul>

<p>She began unlatching her helmet. “I'm taking off my suit, and I'm going in there to help those people out, and rules be damned!”</p>
<p>“I sense her resolve, Commander,” the Vesarian counsellor said. “She probably won't change her mind. We might as well use her knowledge while we know we can.”</p>
<p>The commander thought hard. It was not a good situation. Doctor Anderson's suit was compromised, and she could already be infected for all they knew. He could have <em>Ulysses</em> teleport her back to the ship, in an isolated quarantine chamber, but then they could not get her hands-on opinion of the dying people.</p>
<p>“I hope you know what you're doing, Doctor. If you aren't infected yet, and you take that suit off to handle those sick people in there, you'll almost certainly end up with the illness,” he warned her.</p>
<p>“If I don't go in there, and find a cure for them, and I <em>am</em> infected, then I'm probably as good as dead. I have to help these people, Evan. Let me do my job right, and I'll be okay by the time this is all over,” she assured him.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 101)</h2>
<p>“Aye, sir!” Gregari said, pressing buttons at his science station. There was a pulsing sound as a sensor probe fired from the front of the starship, and they watched it rocket away from them on the flickering display screen.</p>
<p>Soon, the glowing orb vanished from sight, but the science officer maintained remote contact with it. They waited as the minutes passed.</p>
<p>“Do you detect anything, Lieutenant?” Captain Donaldson asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>“Nothing yet, sir.”</p>
<p>More minutes passed, and the ship rumbled as its reactor tried to compensate for the negative effects of the nebula.</p>
<p>“Sir! I'm picking up something,” the lieutenant said. “Trying to define the coordinates... There! Twelve thousand spatials to starboard-fore!”</p>
<p>“What is it? Can you identify it?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>Gregari turned to look up at the captain, “Sorry, sir. The signal's gone. I think it was the <em>Sunriser</em>.”</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet,” the Captain said to Ensign Tremane.</p>
<p>“Channel open, sir.”</p>
<p>The captain thought for a moment, then spoke, “This is <em>Ulysses</em> to fleet: We have detected something twelve thousand spatials to starboard-fore. It could be the <em>Sunriser</em>. All ships, home in on that coordinate. If it is them, they might have detected the probe, and Calimbaer could try to run. We can't let them get away!”</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 102)</h2>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari glanced about at the different computer panels built into the walls. Small stickers with symbols ran down the left side of each display, telling him what parts of the station computer system he could access via those panels. He smiled when he saw a small wrench symbol: station maintenance.</p>
<p>“That one over there,” he said, pointing to the wall display. His fast and experienced fingers ran across the panel's touch screen, as he navigated through menus and system displays. Finally, he found what he was looking for, and ran a maintenance diagnostic program on the access hatch.</p>
<p>“Commander,” he said, turning from the console, “the hatch has been locked from the other side.”</p>
<p>“They locked the hatch... It is a standard quarantine procedure. I guess they put those with the illness into that section of the station to try and avoid contaminating the rest,” Carlson said.</p>
<p>“Except, in this case, those with the illness locked <em>themselves</em> up,” Doctor Anderson pointed out. “That's unusual. What happened to all of those who remained outside of the starboard disc section?”</p>
<p>“It's almost as if the infected people didn't want anyone to reach them,” the counsellor said.</p>
<p>“Some sort of mass paranoia is possible. We don't know anything about the symptoms of the illness affecting them,” Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<ul><li>“I guess we could try and shoot our way through,” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s88.html">(Turn to Section 88)</a></li><li>“Lieutenant, can you use a console to override the lock mechanism, and hack the door open?” Carlson asked the science officer. <a class="turnToSection" href="s149.html">(Turn to Section 149)</a></li><li>“Maybe we can find something in this part of the space station that can help us get through?

<p>The commander peeked out the door, looking up and down the corridor. No Cassians were to be seen – the crew were most likely at battle stations, prepared for any trouble from pursuing Federation starships. That would prove to be in the Task Group's favour, if it were true.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he gestured to the others. They moved down the corridor, Carlson in the lead with the blaster he had acquired, Gregari in the rear with the other blaster, in case someone came up behind them.</p>
<p>They examined labels on doors as they went, searching for a crew member's quarters, among the storerooms, equipment lockers, and maintenance areas. Finally, they found a room labelled “Berth 211”.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” Carlson said, tapping a button by the door. The door slid open, and they quickly slipped into the dark interior. Carlson flicked on the lights, and they looked around.</p>
<p>The Cassian crew berth was similar to any of their own quarters aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>, but stark and sparsely decorated. A few plants were placed in the corners, reminders of the jungles of the Cassian home world of Cassaias.</p>
<p>“Okay, Lieutenant, see if you can patch us into the ship's communication network,” Carlson ordered. Gregari moved to the small computer console against one wall, and began to work.</p>
<p>They waited while he worked, Carlson aiming his blaster at the door in case they were interrupted, and the counsellor feeling out with her senses to try and give warning if any soldiers came near the room.</p>
<p>“Commander, I've patched us into the broadcasting network. We should be able to contact anyone in the vicinity, but if anyone is monitoring ship-side communications, they will know someone is sending a message,” Gregari told him.</p>
<ul><li>“It's a big risk... Perhaps we should hop into an escape pod and jettison away from the ship.

<p>"Computer!" Carlson yelled at a wall console, "We want to go to the nearest shuttle bay!"</p>
<p>"Destination confirmed," the station's computer said, "Please follow the green lights."</p>
<p>"Come on!" the commander waved them on, and they rushed through the space station, following the guiding lights.</p>
<p>"What was that?" Gregari said, as they passed a corridor intersection. They had all heard the familiar sound made by air being replaced by someone being teleported. Glancing down the side passage, they saw more Cassian soldiers appearing!</p>
<p>"Come on! It's this way," Carlson shouted, and led them onwards through the space station. As they rushed around a corner, energy blaster bolts smashed into the wall near them, fired by their pursuers.</p>
<p class="IMAGE"></p>
<p>Stepping through a doorway, they found themselves inside a shuttle bay. A small six-seater shuttle was parked there. Rushing inside, the lieutenant sealed the door, while the commander slapped a button to open the docking bay hatch - just as the Cassian soldiers rushed into the bay.</p>
<p>The Task Group watched as the horrified soldiers slid across the floor, as the large hatch in the space station's hull slid open, pulling them into space as all the air was expelled from the chamber. Moments later, the commander lifted the shuttle off the deck, and they sailed out into space!</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the Sunriser...</strong></p>
<p>"Captain Calimbaer! A shuttle has just launched from the space station!" a Cassian Bridge officer turned to the tiger-like captain of the <em>Sunriser</em>.</p>
<p>"Lock particle beams onto that shuttle! We cannot let them escape!" the captain growled back at him.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>"Captain!" Lieutenant Lewis called out, "A shuttle just launched from the space station!"</p>
<p><em>"Task Group to Ulysses: This is Commander Carlson speaking. Get us the hell out of here!"</em> a voice came over the communications channel.</p>
<p>"Captain to the Teleportation Chamber!" Captain Donaldson shouted into the ship's communication channel, "Bring them aboard this instance, damn-it!"</p>
<p>On the main display screen, they watched as superheated beams of energy blasted out from the <em>Sunriser</em> and engulfed the tiny shuttle. One instant it was there, the next it was gone!</p>
<p>"This is the captain - tell me you got them!" Captain Donaldson shouted into the communications channel.</p>
<p><em>"Captain, this is Commander Carlson. We're all aboard. Let's get out of here, I'll fill you in later!"</em> Carlson replied wearily from the Teleportation Chamber.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Lewis, you heard the man," the captain said. "Let's get the hell out of here!"</p>
<p>As the Cassian military cruiser finished turning to face the <em>Ulysses</em>, and its power built up for a massive weapon strike, the <em>Ulysses</em> suddenly blurred into a stream of light, and rocketed into Hyperspace!</p>

<p>The <em>F.S.S. Vontarres</em> moved away from them to one side, while <em>Ulysses</em> and the other cruiser slowed to a halt, watching on, and praying the <em>Sunriser</em> would not notice them. The <em>Sunriser</em> was also parked, simply drifting in space.</p>
<p>Staying just out of sensor range, the <em>Vontarres</em> moved to the other side of the <em>Sunriser</em>. Suddenly, the <em>Sunriser</em> began to move, turning to one side. It had noticed the <em>Vontarres</em> sailing nearby!</p>

<p>Moments later, the lieutenant stepped out of the lift. With the doctor's help, the science officer moved a Buvu corpse from the required console, then sat down and began working.</p>
<p>Carlson hoped that at least some of their questions were about to be answered.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 107)</h2>
<p>Carlson outlined his plan of attack.</p>
<p>“I will help you,” Doctor Thadasi told them. “Guards, open the door!” he called out, walking over to the door.</p>
<p>The two guards moved over to the cell door, and one of them opened it. As the lion-faced doctor stepped into the doorway, he dropped his tray, sending pills and medical tools clattering to the deck. The guard closest to the door reflexively bent over to help the doctor pick everything up, and in that moment, the Task Group struck!</p>
<p>Carlson charged the door, leaping past the crouching doctor, and smashing his feet into the bent-over guard's face! The guard toppled over backwards, sliding across the floor. At the same time, Gregari raced through the doorway and tackled the other guard, who had yet to reach for his blaster.</p>
<p>Gregari raised his fists above his head and brought them down hard on the forehead of his foe, the guard's head bounced once on the metal deck, then he lay still.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carlson had unclipped his foe's utility belt and proceeded to bind the guard's arms behind his back. Gregari turned his guard over, and quickly followed suit.</p>
<p>The women stepped out of the cell, and looked over the men's handiwork - it had all happened so fast, but went exactly as they planned.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 108)</h2>
<p>The commander turned to a wall-mounted console, and spoke to the space station's computer, “Computer, we wish to go to the starboard disc section.”</p>
<p>“Destination accepted,” the station's computer said. “Please follow the red lights.”</p>
<p>A small red light lit up above a nearby doorframe. The commander and the doctor headed off through the space station, following the guiding lights as they appeared.</p>
<p>The counsellor and science officer began to explore the region around the reception chamber, searching for bodies, or any other signs of what had happened to the non-humans aboard the space station. Had they simply vanished without a trace, or had they fallen sick as well, victims of the illness that had plagued the humans aboard the station?</p>
<p>Eventually, the commander and the doctor arrived at a large circular bulkhead, containing a big hatch. There was a problem, though - the hatch was closed tight.</p>
<ul><li>The commander examined the console beside the hatch, trying to get the door open. <a class="turnToSection" href="s42.html">(Turn to Section 42)</a></li><li>“Doctor, can you use your medical scanner to see how close we are to the survivors?

<h2>(Section &mdash; 109)</h2>
<p>“All right, people, you heard him. Let's get to Engineering and see if we can't take control of this ship!” Carlson ordered.</p>
<p>The commander tapped some buttons on his wristcom, and the small screen lit up with deck plans of the ship, centred on their current location.</p>
<p>“This way,” he said, and they made their way along corridors, through the heart of the ship.</p>
<p>Suddenly, doors slid open ahead of them, and armoured Cassian soldiers stepped out, wielding energy rifles! The Task Group's security officers opened fire, and soon blaster bolts seared through the air in both directions.</p>
<p>Carlson, Blake and Idato pressed themselves against the corridor walls, finding partial cover behind bulkhead beams, and leaned out now and then to fire shots from their blasters.</p>
<p>Two of the security officers collapsed, smoking holes through their chests, but half of the Cassian soldiers had taken hits as well. Then Blake heard marching feet from behind them. Spinning around, he saw more Cassian soldiers coming from behind.</p>
<p>“Grenade!” he shouted, throwing a ship-safe explosive down the corridor, toward the second force. The Task Group members pressed themselves up against the walls as the explosive detonated, decimating the soldiers behind them.</p>
<p>Turning back to the direction they were heading, the Task Group pressed their way down the corridor, firing as they charged! Another security officer went down with two holes in his chest, but moments later, the Cassian force was defeated.</p>
<p>“I'm hit!” Idato called out. He was behind them down the corridor, leaning hard against the wall. Blood trailed down a blaster wound in his side.</p>
<p>“It doesn't look good, Terrance. You need the doctor,” Carlson said, going over and examining the wound.</p>
<p>“Get me to Engineering,” he said bravely. “If I don't re-route Bridge controls to there so I can hack through the destruction sequence, this mission is a failure! I can see Anderson later, if we live long enough.”</p>
<p>Blake knelt down beside the injured man and said, “That's if you survive long enough to disable the destruct sequence. If we find an escape pod, and eject out of here, we'll all survive this hazardous mission. If we take you to engineering, and you die before you disable the destruct sequence, then we're all going to be blown to hell!”</p>
<p>Turning to the commander he added, “But it's you're call, Carlson – this is your mission.”</p>

<p>The others, listening to the silence around them, decided they agreed.</p>
<p>“So, what do you think?” Carlson asked.</p>
<ul><li>“Let's head for the station's Control Centre. Surely someone recorded logs that could explain what has happened around here?” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s154.html">(Turn to Section 154)</a></li><li>“Let's head for the water supply station.

<p>“As a part of the Federation, my species is held by the Treaty of Junction – held in a position of peace with all our neighbours. Our people are growing weak under the banner of the Federation,” the doctor explained. “Hundreds of years ago, we were a fierce people, a proud people who lived for the hunt! This age of peace has sapped us of our strength, dulled our hunter instincts. By forcing our home world to remove itself from the Federation and make war upon the humans and their allies, we are helping our people return to their glorious past!”</p>
<p>The Task Group members looked at each other in horror. A so-called civilised culture wanted to return to the barbaric ages of its past?</p>
<p>“You, an intelligent, trained doctor of the Federation of Worlds, want to see the galaxy plunged into war?” Doctor Anderson asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I didn't think you were trained to hack locking systems," Carlson said.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have to hack into the locking system. The Control Centre on this space station should be much like the Bridge of the <em>Ulysses</em> - each major system and subsystem of the station could be overridden by direct commands from the Control Centre's command consoles. That way, in an emergency, the officers could still maintain manual control of the space station," Lieutenant Gregari explained.</p>
<p>"That makes sense," Counsellor Miva Lontira agreed with him.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's get to the Control Centre," Carlson said, walking over to a nearby wall console. "Computer, we want to go to the Control Centre."</p>
<p>"Location confirmed," the station's computer spoke from the console, "Please follow the gold lights."</p>
<p>A golden light lit up above a nearby door. "Come on," Carlson said, as they hurried through the central section of the space station, following the golden lights that lit up to show them the way.</p>
<p>An eerie silence filled the areas they passed through, and they couldn't help but wonder what had happened to all the residents of the space station who had not locked themselves in the starboard disc section.</p>
<p>Eventually, they travelled up a lift into the dome-like Control Centre that protruded from the top of the station. What they saw as they stepped out of the lift took everyone's breath away.</p>
<p>The non-human officers of Pegasi Station were all here in the Control Centre - and they were all very, very dead.</p>
<p>“This is not good... Doctor, Lieutenant Gregari, I think you had better scan these bodies now,” Carlson ordered.</p>

<p>The commander peeked out the door, looking up and down the corridor. No Cassians were to be seen – the crew were most likely at battle stations, prepared for any trouble from pursuing Federation starships. That would prove to be in the Task Group's favour, if it were true.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he gestured to the others. They moved down the corridor, Carlson leading the way.</p>
<p>“Commander,” the Vesarian counsellor said, opening her eyes, “I sense some Cassians soldiers in the vicinity. They seem to be heading toward our location!”</p>
<p>Carlson gestured to a nearby wall-screen. “Lieutenant,” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Use the ship's computer to locate the nearest escape pod on this deck of the ship.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the lieutenant brought up deck plans of the <em>Sunriser</em>, and searched for the nearest pod's hatch. “Right here,” he said, pointing to the map on the display.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” the commander ordered, and they hurried down the corridor, and around a corner. Then, from behind, they heard a shout. Glancing over his shoulder, Carlson saw Cassian soldiers behind them, at the other end of the corridor. They were drawing their blasters, while one of them pointed at the escaping prisoners!</p>
<p>Carlson shouted a warning, and the team leapt aside, pressing themselves against the walls as energy bolts blasted down the corridor towards them.</p>
<p>“That way!” Gregari shouted, and pointed down one of the side passages. They rushed around the corner, while energy blasts from the soldiers' weapons exploded against a nearby wall!</p>
<p>“There it is!” Carlson pointed to the end of the passage, which ended in a large pod-hatch.</p>
<p>They reached the hatch just as the soldiers rounded the corridor. Carlson punched the large button by the pod-hatch, and the hatch began swinging open.</p>
<p>The soldiers stood, feet apart, and fired down the corridor at them. Gregari twisted, and fell backwards against the wall, struck in the thigh and left shoulder.</p>
<p>“Get inside!” Carlson shouted at the women, standing, arms wide, between the soldiers and the hatch, while the women helped the wounded science officer inside.</p>
<p>The soldiers fired another volley, one shot smashing into the wall above the hatch, the other hitting the commander in the side, causing him to spin, toppling through the open hatch, half into the escape pod.</p>
<p>The counsellor pulled him the whole way inside, and slapped a large button to close the hatch. They heard energy bolts impacting against the other side of the hatch as it closed, while the soldiers continued to fire after them, then suddenly, the whole pod shuddered, as it launched into space!</p>
<p>“Activate the beacon!” Carlson ordered, eyes clenched in pain, and the doctor flipped a switch at the front of the escape pod. A red light began flashing, as the pod began broadcasting its automated cry for help.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the F.S.S. Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>“Sir!” Blake called out from his security console, where he had been analysing sensor signals.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Captain Donaldson asked, his attention still gripped on the flickering screen, watching the <em>Sunriser </em>moving to attack them.</p>
<p>“One of the <em>Sunriser's</em> escape pods just jettisoned!” Blake told him.</p>
<p>“An escape pod? Could it be our missing team?” Captain Donaldson mused.</p>
<p>“It could be enemy soldiers evacuating their ship – surely they realise they are outnumbered three to one!” Lieutenant Lewis said.</p>
<p>“Sir, we're getting a transmission from the pod,” Ensign Tremane said from her communication console.</p>
<p>“Patch it through,” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>“<em>Task Group to Ulysses: We made it into an escape pod, feel free to fire on the Sunriser!</em>” Commander Carlson called out over the pod's emergency channel.</p>
<p>“Hail the fleet,” the captain said, then addressed the navy cruisers, “<em>Ulysses </em>to fleet: our people are safe. Target the <em>Sunriser</em> – don't let it escape!”</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser </em>began changing course for a swift retreat from the three Federation starships.</p>
<p>“We can't let it get too far from us now, if we lose it again, we'll never find her in this nebula cloud!” the captain said. “Chief Thomas,” he turned to Blake, “Lock particle cannons onto the <em>Sunriser's </em>engines, and fire when ready!”</p>
<p class="IMAGE"></p>
<p class="IMAGE"/><p class="IMAGE"></p>
<p class="IMAGE"></p>
<p class="IMAGE"></p>
<p>Moments later, the twin particle cannons mounted on the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapon pylons fired, sending an arcing torrent of energy towards the <em>Sunriser</em> like two bolts of lightning! Their targeting systems were affected by the nebula, one of the shots went wide, but the second one lashed against the unshielded hull of the <em>Sunriser</em>, sending glowing red hull fragments into space from around the ship's engines!</p>
<p>The two military cruisers also fired upon the fleeing ship, only one of their shots struck their target, wreaking more damage upon the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines. The ship shuddered under the assault, and began turning back towards the Federation starships. It looked like it was not going down without a fight.</p>

<blockquote>“A number of our human contingent have began showing signs of illness, and Doctor Phisanthi has no idea what might be causing this outbreak. Symptoms include dizzy spells, frequent vomiting, and retching. The Earth representative here issued a plea to a nearby Federation Starbase a moment ago, requesting they send a medical team here with all haste. He fears some dangerous virus or disease is affecting the humans here. So far, none of the other races here have been affected by this malady. It appears to be a purely human ailment, and we are saddened to see our human friends being taken ill so suddenly. Doctor Phisanthi will continue to examine the patients being brought in, trying to identify the cause of this illness, but I fear the number of sick is increasing faster than the good doctor can handle.

Six Buvus, eight Cassians, and two Vesarians have died in the last hour, while the humans, though nearly all of them are now quite ill, have yet to suffer any such casualties. There has been some questions among the Cassians about why the humans are not dying from this outbreak. Someone appallingly suggested that anyone who was infected be spaced, to ensure the illness would not continue to spread. Spaced! Things are starting to get out of hand here.

<p>“I hope you're right, Blake!” Carlson shouted.</p>
<p>The Cassian officers, listening to the conversation, suddenly charged!</p>
<p>“Protect Blake!” Carlson shouted, and the security officers took a position between Blake and the enemy, opening fire. Two of the enemy officers flipped backwards, sliding across the deck with smoking holes in their uniforms.</p>
<p>The other Cassians leapt forwards, and tackled the security officers. The pairs wrestled for their lives. Carlson noted Calimbaer had remained crouched at the other end of the Bridge, hiding behind a console.</p>
<p>Carlson and Idato stood on the other side of Blake's console, aiming their weapons, searching for targets, but they could not fire for fear of shooting their own men.</p>
<p>“Commander!” Blake shouted, as the lighting throughout the ship changed back to a pale white light, “I've disabled the destruct sequence!”</p>
<p>Carlson quickly pressed buttons on his wristcom, “<em>Ulysses </em>Task Group to the fleet: Security teams, teleport to the <em>Sunriser's</em> Bridge, now!”</p>
<p>In an instant, two dozen security officers blinked into existence, levelling their energy rifles at the struggling pairs rolling about the deck.</p>
<p>The commander raised his voice, “Cassian officers, we have established control of your vessel. Surrender now, or face immediate execution for your crimes against Pegasi Station.”</p>
<p>The Cassian officers slowly stopped struggling, seeing they were surrounded and out-gunned. They stood up, raising their paws above their heads.</p>
<p>“You won't take us alive!” Captain Calimbaer screamed from the other end of the bridge, and leapt up, firing wildly at Carlson with his blaster.</p>
<p>Carlson felt a bolt smash into his shoulder as he span to the deck, while nearly a dozen men opened fire on the enemy captain. Calimbaer twitched and flopped face down onto the deck, his tattered uniform smoking.</p>
<p>The threat was over - for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Carlson pressed a button on his wristcom, and spoke into it once more, “Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: Captain, resistance has been neutralised. The ship is ours. However, I regret to inform you that Captain Calimbaer chose to die rather than be taken prisoner. We'll get no answers out of him.”</p>
<p>“<em>A pity</em>,” the captain responded. “<em>However, I am sure Federation Intelligence will be able to get something useful out of the others aboard the Sunriser. Well done, Commander.</em>”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Calimbaer's loss was a shame, for he could have provided many answers. However, on the journey to Starbase 14, Security Chief Blake Thomas questioned some of the prisoners that had been taken.</p>
<p>It seemed that the <em>Sunriser</em> crew belonged to a newly emerging faction on the Cassian home world of Cassaias. They called themselves 'Purebloods', and claimed their lineage ran back to the Kings of Old on their home world.</p>
<p>This Pureblood faction had Captain Donaldson worried. Their core belief was simple. They believed they were better than everyone else.</p>
<p>They believed that years of peace under the Federation of Worlds had sapped their hunter strength, and natural instincts, and it was time to return to the conquering path of their ancient ancestors. They did not wish to rule over the other species of the galaxy for power or riches - they simply believed it was their birthright to rule, that they were the only species capable of the strength and wisdom required to rule the galaxy.</p>
<p>There was no way of knowing how deep the roots of this new faction ran among the Cassian population, and that would be enough to get High Command worried. Who was to know how many other Federation starships, crewed by Cassians, would turn upon their allies, attacking under a Pureblood banner?</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Lewis, plot a course for Starbase 14,” Captain Donaldson ordered. “Our mission here is over, but I think the danger to the Federation of Worlds is just beginning...”</p>
<p><strong>Mission Successful.</strong></p>
<p>Well done! You achieved all mission goals! You found out what was going on at Pegasi Station, you discovered what the <em>Sunriser</em> had done, and you uncovered news of a new militant faction that could threaten the entire Federation!</p>
<p>Your mission ends here.</p>

<p>"A wise thought," Counsellor Lontira agreed with him.</p>
<p>"If there aren't any life signs outside of the humans in the starboard disc section, then it should be pretty safe around here, don't you think Commander? Why don't we split up, it will make the search go faster," Doctor Anderson suggested.</p>
<ul><li>“No... I've got a bad feeling about this place. It's one thing for all the humans to fall sick from exposure to a banned drug, it's another thing for the eighty or more non-humans to disappear.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 117)</h2>
<p>One of the military cruisers moved in to form up behind the <em>Ulysses</em>, while the other turned and headed off along the second fading trail.</p>
<p>“Move to hyperspace,” the captain ordered, and the <em>Ulysses</em> and its escorting cruiser became two blurs, moving after the first hyperspace distortion trail at full speed. They followed the trail for two hours, before the captain noticed a small coloured smudge growing in the distance.</p>
<p>“Ensign Hob, what lies ahead of us on the star charts?” he asked the young navigator.</p>
<p>The ensign navigated through the ship's database on his console, then turned to look up at the captain, “Sir, it's Magniir 517, a small class six nebula.”</p>
<p>“Class six... is our heading going to pass through the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“At the moment it looks that way, sir. Class six means running slow - and without shields.”</p>
<p>“I'm aware of that, Ensign,” the captain said.</p>
<p>A short while later, they received an incoming message from the second cruiser, “<em>This is Vontarres to Ulysses: we've caught up with the starship that left the second trail. It's just an automated cargo carrier. We've set an intercept course to meet up with you. At your current heading, we should reach you in another two hours.</em>”</p>
<p>“Understood,” Captain Donaldson replied. He watched the form of the small nebula growing on the display screen before them. It was looming large when the other military cruiser arrived and joined their formation.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Lewis, does the distortion trail we're following continue on this heading, into the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the helmsman replied.</p>
<p>“Then we're going in. It could be a good place to hide, and I'm sure Captain Calimbaer would think the same thing. If we're lucky, the <em>Sunriser</em> is parked somewhere in there.”</p>

<p>“I was part of the research team testing the drug in its early days,” Doctor Anderson admitted. “When we deemed it unfit for people to use, the project was cancelled. I am uncertain as to how anyone out here could have gained access to the formula, or why anyone would expose all the humans here to the substance.”</p>
<p><em>“Yes, it is a puzzle, Doctor,”</em> the captain said. <em>“So, have you looked at anything else aboard the station? Are there signs of the other non-human inhabitants, or of what happened to them?”</em></p>
<p><a class="turnToSection" href="s13.html">(Turn to Section 13)</a></p>

<p>“Lieutenant Gregari, we need to know where the <em>Sunriser</em> has gone. Can you run a scan for traces of hyperspace distortions?” Captain Donaldson asked the science officer.</p>
<p>“I'll get on it immediately,” Gregari replied.</p>
<p>The three Federation starships came out of hyperspace close by.</p>
<p>“Incoming communication, Captain,” Ensign Tremane said.</p>
<p>“On screen,” the captain said, standing and looking towards the main display screen. The beaked face of a bird-like Aganar appeared. The Aganars were one of the major interstellar species who had signed the original Treaty of Junction, taking part in the formation of the Federation of Worlds over a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>The feathery humanoid spoke with a scratchy, lilting accent, “<em>With greetings I address you, humans. I am Captain Slirnok of the medical evacuation vessel F.S.S. Glagnar. What would be the nature of this emergency?</em>”</p>
<p>“There are around eighty humans aboard Pegasi Station, in a very sickly state. Their condition is only temporary,” the captain explained. “They should be back to full health in another twenty hours or so, but the water aboard the station is contaminated and must not be used under any circumstances.”</p>
<p>“<em>I understand, human. We shall bring them aboard, and aid in their recovery. I shall arrange for the station's water supplies to be decontaminated. Do not fear, human, this situation is under control. Glagnar out,</em>” the Aganar cut off communications, and the ship drew closer to the space station.</p>
<p>More communications came in, from the two cruisers. Captain Donaldson quickly explained the situation to them, and their captains placed themselves under his command.</p>
<p>“Have you detected a probable heading yet, Lieutenant?” Captain Donaldson asked his science officer.</p>
<p>“I've picked up three hyperspace distortion trails. One of them was when we headed out of here four hours ago. The other two are unknown. Logic would suggest the Sunriser left one of those trails as it fled from here. The first trail has a stronger signature than the second one, implying it passed here more recently. All readings are growing pretty faint – I'm surprised our trail was still visible.”</p>
<p>“So... which trail do we follow?” Captain Donaldson said to himself, sitting down again, and watching the slowly spinning space station on the main display screen.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to the fleet, Ensign,” he said to the communications officer. “This is <em>Ulysses</em>: We have detected two hyperspace distortion trails. One of them should be the <em>Sunriser</em>. The other is an unknown ship – perhaps an automated freighter passing through the region.”</p>

<p>Counsellor Miva Lontira closed her eyes, letting her self-awareness, and the sights and sounds of the Bridge fade from her thoughts.</p>
<p>Reaching out into space with her heart and mind, she focused her attentions on the drifting spaceship ahead of them. A sudden surge of emotions washed over her, and she did her best to filter through the sensory information for individual feelings she could identify.</p>
<p>“I sense... fear in some of their hearts. However, at the same time, this emotion is mixed with a sense of greater purpose, and satisfaction. I feel... confidence, almost arrogance, from some of them. They do not feel defeated, but I suspect they are planning some other form of action against us. What it might be, I do not yet know.”</p>
<p>She drew back into herself, and allowed herself to focus on her own body, her own thoughts and feelings, as she woke from her empathic trance.</p>
<p>“What do you think, Commander?” the captain asked his first officer.</p>
<p>Carlson thought before answering. “If the counsellor is correct, then if we asked for surrender, and they accepted, they could not be trusted to abide by their surrender. I suspect the moment they are able to fire their weapons again, they will try to attack us when we don't expect it.”</p>
<p>“I concur,” the captain said. “Open a channel to the fleet, Ensign.”</p>
<p>Ensign Tremane pressed a few switches, then signalled the captain.</p>

<p>Acting in unison, Gregari tackled another soldier, while the women drew their blasters and fired at the third soldier.</p>
<p>The attack worked! The soldier the women shot at was caught by surprise, firing twice as he fell backwards, sliding across the deck with a hole in his chest. Carlson knocked the enemy officer unconscious, then helped Gregari subdue the last soldier.</p>
<p>Then they heard the doctor gasping, and turned to find she had been shot by a stray blast from the dead Cassian soldier. The wound was not fatal, but serious enough that she needed medical attention soon.</p>
<p>"We've got to get past the communication jam on this station, and warn the <em>Ulysses</em> of what's happening! We can't teleport her to the ship until we're outside of the jam, so they can lock onto our positions!" Gregari said desperately, helping the doctor to stand. They headed into the lift, and headed away from the Control Centre.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, we still need proof that the crew of the <em>Sunriser</em> were responsible for what happened, or whatever faction or sect they represent. We need to know who belonged to ID Card 7254-A," Carlson said.</p>
<p>"We could always send the ID number to Starbase 14. Surely they'd have the person's name on employment records?" Doctor Anderson pointed out, as they stepped out of the lift.</p>
<p>“Okay, we head for the nearest shuttle bay, and get the hell out of here!” Carlson ordered.</p>

<p>“As a part of the Federation, we are held by the Treaty of Junction – held in a position of peace with all our neighbours. Our people are growing weak under the banner of the Federation,” the doctor explained. “Hundreds of years ago, we were a fierce people, a proud people who lived for the hunt! This age of peace has sapped us of our strength, dulled our hunter instincts. By forcing our home world to remove itself from the Federation and make war upon the humans and their allies, we are helping our people return to their glorious past!”</p>
<p>The Task Group members looked at each other in horror. A civilised culture wanted to return to the barbaric ages of its past?</p>
<p>“You, an intelligent, trained doctor of the Federation of Worlds, want to see the galaxy plunged into war?” Doctor Anderson asked in astonishment. </p>

<p>They slowly walked through the hatch, and into the portside disc section of the station. They spread out in the main corridor, and glanced into some of the rooms. Each of them saw the same thing.</p>
<p>The rooms were littered with bodies. Some lay where they had fallen onto the floor, others were in beds. A few even sat slumped at consoles they had been trying to use in their final hour. The Task Group members gathered in a large room, the Commander and Counsellor standing back while Gregari and Doctor Anderson scanned the bodies.</p>
<p>"All of them are the same, Commander," the doctor told him. "Each of them has been exposed to strong doses of the Earth drug Bihosanzamene. I just don't get it! In humans, the drug is not lethal, but it seems to be deadly poison to the Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians here. It looks like the side effects of the drug took a while to kick in, rather than affecting them straight away like the humans were. But how were they poisoned? They would have had to swallow the drug, or be injected with it, but I can't imagine every person on the ship letting themselves be injected by a medical experiment that had been cancelled years ago! No one out here should even know of the drug's existence!"</p>

<p>The three loyal Federation starships moved as fast as they could, slowed down by the effects of the cloud. After a few minutes, the display screen began to flicker rapidly, and sensor detail became greatly diminished.</p>
<p>“We're almost running blind out here,” Ensign Hobb muttered from his navigation console.</p>
<p>“Hey, what's that?” Lieutenant Lewis said, pointing to one side of the display screen. The screen fell into more visual distortions. Everyone looked at the screen, searching for anything recognisable amid the flickering image on the display.</p>
<p>For a moment it cleared again, and they all saw it. The <em>Sunriser, </em>only two thousand spatials away, and heading right for them!</p>
<p>“Open a channel, Ensign!” the captain shouted, and waited for her signal.</p>
<p>“<em>Ulysses</em> to fleet – we've found her! All ships to red alert! Prepare for-” he was interrupted.</p>
<p>Three arcing streams of white energy stabbed at them from the <em>Sunriser</em>. The enemy ship's sensors were as distorted as theirs in the nebula cloud. Two of the artificial lightning bolts went wide, but one of them struck the <em>Ulysses</em> and ravaged its way across the upper hull!</p>
<p>Without shield protection, the <em>Ulysses</em> shuddered wildly under the attack, and the captain nearly fell from his command chair. Warning klaxons sounded throughout the ship.</p>
<p>“Target acquired!” Lieutenant Lewis cried from the helm.</p>
<p>“Fire, Lewis! Fire!” the captain shouted.</p>
<p>Two energy streams blasted outward from the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapon pylons. Both artificial lightning bolts curved wide, and away from the <em>Sunriser</em>,<em> </em>missing her completely.</p>
<p>“Sir, another direct hit from the <em>Sunriser</em>, and we're space dust!” Lieutenant Lewis shouted.</p>
<p>Then, six energy streams arced in at the <em>Sunriser</em> from both sides, as the other two cruisers moved into position. </p>
<p>Half of the energy streams hit the Cassian cruiser, blasting away furiously at its unshielded hull. Moments later, the <em>Sunriser </em>listed to one side, and began to drift aimlessly.</p>
<p>“We've got her!” Lieutenant Lewis shouted, to a brief cheer from the other officers.</p>
<p>“Steady now,” Captain Donaldson said. “Our task is not complete yet. We need prisoners – High Command has questions they want answered.”</p>
<ul><li>“Ensign Tremane, hail the <em>Sunriser</em>,” he said, turning to the communications officer. “Let's give them a chance to surrender.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s24.html">(Turn to Section 24)</a></li><li>The captain thought for a moment, then turned to the Vesarian counsellor, “Before we do anything else, I would be interested in knowing what you sense aboard their ship.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s71.html">(Turn to Section 71)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 126)</h2>
<p>“Okay,” Doctor Anderson said, pulling out her hand-held medical scanner, and toggling through its modes. She held it out before her, and waved it in the direction of the hatch.</p>
<p>“There are about sixty life forms in the starboard disc section of this station, spread throughout that area. It looks like the life signs are weak, perhaps near death. We're probably running out of time, Commander,” she told him.</p>
<p>The commander pressed a button on his wristcom, then spoke into the microphone built into his helmet, “Lieutenant Gregari, we've found the hatch into the starboard disc section of the station, but it's sealed shut. Do you think you can come over here and help us out?”</p>
<p><a class="turnToSection" href="s32.html">(Turn to Section 32)</a></p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 127)</h2>
<p>“Commander,” the Vesarian counsellor said, opening her eyes, “I sense some Cassians soldiers in the vicinity. They seem to be heading toward our location!”</p>
<p>“Lieutenant,” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Use that console to locate the nearest escape pod on this deck of the ship.”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the lieutenant brought up deck plans of the <em>Sunriser</em>, and searched for the nearest pod's hatch. “Right here,” he said, pointing to the map on the display.</p>
<p>“Let's go,” the commander ordered, and went to the door. Looking out quickly, he glanced both ways down the corridor. The soldiers had not reached the corridor yet.</p>
<p>Quickly, they stepped out, and headed to the left. Then, from behind, they heard a shout. Glancing over his shoulder, Carlson saw some Cassian soldiers at the other end of the corridor. They were drawing their blasters, one of them pointing at the escaped prisoners! Carlson fired a short blast in their direction, causing them to jump aside.</p>
<p>“That way!” Gregari shouted, and pointed down one of the side passages. They rushed around the corner, while energy blasts from the soldiers' weapons exploded against a nearby wall!</p>
<p>“There it is!” Carlson pointed to the end of the passage, which ended in a large pod-hatch.</p>
<p>They reached the hatch just as the soldiers rounded the corridor. Carlson and Gregari wildly fired their blasters down the corridor at the soldiers, missing them, but causing them to scatter.</p>
<p>One of the soldiers fired with greater accuracy. Lieutenant Gregari shook, and fell backwards against the wall, struck in the thigh and one shoulder. While injured, he continued to fight, keeping his grip on his blaster, and shooting more energy bolts at the incoming soldiers.</p>
<p>“Get the hatch open!” Carlson shouted at the women, while the doctor worked at buttons beside the hatch. He crouched, taking aim, and fired a bolt directly into the chest of one of the Cassian soldiers! The soldier roared, as he was flung backwards, tumbling to the deck.</p>
<p>“It's opening!” Doctor Anderson cried out, as the hatch slid aside. The women helped the wounded science officer into the escape pod, while Carlson laid down covering fire, causing the remaining soldiers to take cover behind a bulkhead.</p>
<p>“Commander, come on!” the doctor shouted, and Carlson leapt into the escape pod. Slapping a large button, he closed the hatch. They heard energy bolts impacting against the other side of the hatch, as the soldiers continued to fire after them, then suddenly, the whole pod shuddered, as it launched into space!</p>
<p>“Activate the beacon!” Carlson ordered, and the counsellor flipped a switch at the front of the escape pod. A red light began flashing, as the pod began broadcasting its automated cry for help.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the F.S.S. Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>“Sir!” Security Chief Blake called out from his console, where he had been analysing sensor signals.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Captain Donaldson asked, his attention still gripped to the flickering screen, watching the <em>Sunriser </em>moving to attack them.</p>
<p>“One of the <em>Sunriser's</em> escape pods just jettisoned!” Blake told him.</p>
<p>“An escape pod? Could it be our missing team?” Donaldson mused.</p>
<p>“It could be enemy soldiers evacuating their ship – surely they realise they are outnumbered three to one!” Lieutenant Lewis said.</p>
<p>“Sir, we're getting a transmission from the pod,” Ensign Tremane said from her communication console.</p>
<p>“Patch it through,” the captain ordered.</p>
<p>“<em>Task Group to Ulysses: We made it into an escape pod, feel free to fire on the Sunriser!</em>” Commander Carlson called out over the pod's emergency channel.</p>
<p>“Hail the fleet,” the captain said, then addressed the navy cruisers, “<em>Ulysses </em>to fleet: our people are safe. Target the <em>Sunriser</em> – don't let it escape!”</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser </em>began changing course for a swift retreat from the three Federation starships.</p>
<p>“We can't let it get too far from us now, if we lose it again, we'll never find her in this nebula cloud!” the captain said. “Chief Thomas,” he turned to Blake, “Lock particle cannons onto the <em>Sunriser's </em>engines, and fire when ready!”</p>
<p>Moments later, the twin particle cannons mounted on the <em>Ulysses'</em> weapon pylons fired, sending an arcing torrent of energy towards the <em>Sunriser</em> like two bolts of lightning! Their targeting systems were affected by the nebula, one of the shots went wide, but the second one lashed against the unshielded hull of the <em>Sunriser</em>, sending glowing red hull fragments into space from around the ship's engines!</p>
<p>The two military cruisers also fired upon the fleeing ship, only one of their shots struck their target, wreaking more damage upon the <em>Sunriser's</em> engines. The ship shuddered under the assault, and began turning back towards the Federation starships. It looked like it was not going down without a fight.</p>

<p>“Hey, it was just an idea,” Gregari said defensively.</p>
<p>“A wise decision, Commander,” the counsellor said.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 129)</h2>
<p>The two military cruisers moved into formation as the <em>Ulysses</em> moved out, following after the first hyperspace distortion trail at full speed. Captain Donaldson watched the large expanse of stars on the main display screen, and hoped they had made the right decision. There could be no turning back to follow the other trail, it would have faded away.</p>
<p>He also noticed a smudge of colour directly ahead of them that began to grow larger as they travelled.</p>
<p>“Ensign Hob, what lies ahead of us on the star charts?” he asked the young navigator.</p>
<p>The ensign navigated through the ship's database on his console, then turned to look up at the captain, “Sir, it's Magniir 517, a small class six nebula.”</p>
<p>“Class six... is our heading going to pass through the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“It looks that way, sir. Class six means running slow - and without shields.”</p>
<p>“I'm aware of that, Ensign,” the captain said.</p>
<p>After another two hours, the nebula loomed large before them.</p>
<p>“Lieutenant Gregari, does the distortion trail we're following continue on this heading, into the nebula?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“Aye, sir,” the science officer replied.</p>
<p>“Then we're going in. It could be a good place to hide, and I'm sure Captain Calimbaer would think the same thing. If we're lucky, the <em>Sunriser</em> is parked somewhere in there.”</p>

<p><em>"We are making our own investigations into this matter, Captain Donaldson,"</em> the Cassian said, almost spitting out the words.

<p>"Very well, but if we may assist you in any way, don't hesitate to-" Captain Donaldson began, but the screen blanked out suddenly.</p>
<p>"What happened?" the captain asked his communications officer.</p>

<p>The Cassian doctor sighed, “No, war is the last thing on my mind, but this goes beyond myself, beyond this ship. There is a new faction on my home world of Cassaias, people who call for the old ways. They call themselves the <em>Purebloods</em> – and many can trace their bloodlines back to the kings of old! They teach us that our species is above yours, above all the others. Our people were born to rule! Yet... my medical oath prohibits me to kill, or injure another person, and I have stood by and let even fellow Cassians die such horrible deaths, back on Pegasi Station. I just – there isn't anything I can do about it.”</p>
<p>“Stay loyal to the Federation of Worlds,” Counsellor Lontira said softly. “Regain what honour you have lost through your involvement in this new faction, help us to escape this ship so that the truth can be told, and High Command can be warned!”</p>
<p>“No, I have gone too far along this path. There is no place for me back in the Federation. But... I won't stop you. I won't activate the alarm. Find a way off this ship, and warn High Command of the Purebloods. This faction will do anything to shatter the peace of the Federation of Worlds, and place themselves on top.”</p>
<p>“How do we get out of here?” Gregari asked. “There are two armed guards on the other side of those bars.”</p>
<ul><li>“Perhaps... I have an anaesthetic spray.

<p>“I always wanted to do this,” the young lieutenant said, as he carefully placed the Detpack on the hatch seal.</p>

<p>He pressed a button on the Detpack, and...</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>“Sir!” Lieutenant Michael Lewis, the ship's helmsman, called out from his console.</p>
<p>“What is it, Lieutenant?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“There's been a small explosion aboard Pegasi Station, sir!” the helmsman said in alarm.</p>
<p>The captain flicked a switch on the arm of his command chair. “<em>Ulysses</em> to Task Group: This is Captain Donaldson. Our sensors have registered an explosion aboard the station, what is the situation over there?”</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>“Commander Carlson, respond,” the captain ordered nervously.</p>

<p>"Aye, sir!" Lieutenant Lewis pushed the shields up to full power.</p>
<p>As the Cassian vessel finished its turn, it suddenly lashed out at them with multiple streams of superheated energy, like artificial lightning strikes! The <em>Ulysses</em> shook heavily under the barrage.</p>
<p>"Sir! Shields down to fifty percent!" Lieutenant Lewis called out.</p>
<p>"Damn-it! We're allies!" the captain shouted at the screen, "This doesn't make sense!"</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 134)</h2>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> made for Starbase 14 at full speed. Long-range sensors showed that the <em>Sunriser</em> had not given chase. Captain Donaldson knew that the <em>Ulysses </em>was no match for a fully armed military cruiser, and feared for the lives of the humans who were still lying sick in the starboard disc section of the space station.</p>
<p>“Open a channel to Admiral Branson at Starbase 14,” Captain Donaldson ordered.</p>
<p>“Channel open, sir,” Ensign Tremane said, having anticipated the request.</p>
<p>The captain stood, addressing the main display screen, as the ageing face of the old admiral appeared.</p>
<p>“This is Captain Donaldson. I'll make this quick. While investigating Pegasi Station, we found that the water supply had been tainted by an Earth drug that never went into production because of its harmful side effects. All of the non-human residents of the station died after drinking the poisoned water, but it would seem the drug is not lethal to humans, so they are expected to recover fully within a starday. We are uncertain as to how the formula for a cancelled medical experiment could have resurfaced way out here.”</p>
<p>The admiral looked quite shocked by this revelation, but the captain continued, “Shortly after, the <em>F.S.S. Sunriser</em> arrived at the scene, and attempted to interfere with our investigation. Our Task Group discovered that around the time people began falling ill, the <em>Sunriser</em> had been at the station. What is more, we suspect an unidentified person of poisoning the water supply, then escaping aboard the <em>Sunriser</em> as it left the station.”</p>
<p>The admiral looked gravely at the captain, <em>“Jeffrey, you do understand the implications of what you are saying. The Cassians have been a key member of the Federation of Worlds since before Earth even joined.”</em></p>
<p>“I know, Admiral. They attempted to take my Task Group prisoner, and were prepared to destroy my vessel. However, I understand that aggressive actions against my people are one thing, and accusing the <em>Sunriser</em> of poisoning Pegasi Station, and even killing some of their own people, is a different matter. Lieutenant Gregari was able to retrieve the I.D. Card number of the person we suspect introduced the poison into the water supply. Their details had been erased from station computers, but I'm sure you can find them in Starbase 14's assignment records.”</p>
<p><em>“Give me the number,”</em> Admiral Branson said.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Admiral Branson came back to the screen, <em>“Captain, it is as you probably suspected. A Cassian engineer, name of Saarab, was on record with that I.D. number. Of greater interest, we found that Saarab's previous posting had been as an engineer aboard the Sunriser. That's all the proof High Command needs. Yesterday, when we suspected a bio-weapon was being tested, we redirected two Federation cruisers and a medical evacuation vessel to join you at Pegasi Station. They should arrive there in another couple hours. Your orders are to return to Pegasi Station, join up with the cruisers, and attempt to capture the Sunriser. We need prisoners, Jeffrey, so we can find out if these are the actions of a single renegade vessel with a grudge against humans, or if this plot is part of some deeper conspiracy against the Federation of Worlds.”</em></p>
<p>“Orders received and understood, admiral. <em>Ulysses</em> out,” Captain Donaldson said, and Ensign Tremane closed the channel.</p>
<p>Turning to address his Bridge officers, he said, “It would seem our mission here is not over. We must apprehend Captain Calimbaer and his crew, and find out if they were acting alone, or if someone other than the High Command is giving orders to Federation starships.”</p>
<p>The <em>Ulysses</em> reversed course, and returned to Pegasi Station. Long-range sensors soon showed the other three Federation starships homing in on the station, and more notably, the absence of the <em>Sunriser</em>. The renegade Cassian cruiser had fled the scene, probably suspecting that the <em>Ulysses</em> had contacted the nearest Starbase by then, and their plot could no longer possibly succeed.</p>

<p>"Just give me a moment... Here we are - twenty-six hours ago, almost exactly. That's around the time everyone began falling sick!"</p>
<p>"Was any maintenance work conducted on the water pipes or machinery at that time?" the commander asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see what you're thinking," the science officer grinned, and pressed a few more buttons. "Here we are, at exactly twenty-six hours and two minutes ago, someone accessed maintenance hatch 47B using maintenance card 7254-A. I'll just bring up the station personnel records, and find out who was assigned that identity number."</p>
<p>"You do that, and I'll let the captain know we're finally getting somewhere," the commander said, pressing a button on his wristcom. "Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: Captain, we've found proof that the water supply was poisoned by someone, and now we're closing in on that person's identity!"</p>
<p>There was static from the other end.</p>
<p>"Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: Do you read me, over?" the commander asked.</p>
<p>There was nothing but static.</p>
<p>"That doesn't sound good," Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>"I think someone's jammed communications," Carlson said.</p>
<p>"Didn't the captain say the Cassians just teleported some people aboard the station?" the doctor asked, worriedly.</p>
<p>"Commander," Gregari said, "Someone's deleted some records from this computer. There's no record of who the ID number 7254-A belonged to. The information has been erased!"</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, I've got a hunch... Check the flight control records, and see if any starships were in the vicinity at the time the water supply was poisoned," Carlson ordered.</p>
<p>"Okay, sir... Just a minute... <em>By the Suns of Centauri!</em> The <em>Sunriser</em> was loading and unloading cargo here at the time the water supply was poisoned!" Gregari said, astounded by his find.</p>
<p>"We're dealing with rogues, or some anti-Federation sect," the commander said. "It looks like they were willing to kill their own people, if it meant making humans look bad. I would guess that they're trying to accuse the humans of killing non-humans, in an attempt to divide the governments of the Federation - and drive us apart, or into war. However, just showing that the military cruiser was here at the time does not prove a thing - we need to find proof, we need the name of the person who was using that identity card!"</p>
<ul><li>“Sir, if you can get me to the Data Access Storage Chamber, I should be able to look at the station's back-up files, and find a copy of the data before the person's name was deleted!” Gregari said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s56.html">(Turn to Section 56)</a></li><li>“The captain could send a hyperspace message back to Starbase 14. They might have the ID number on file,” Doctor Anderson suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s135.html">(Turn to Section 135)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 138)</h2>
<p>“Commander,” Doctor Anderson turned to him, looking rather nervous, “I think it would be wiser to leave explosive devices in the hands of trained security specialists.”</p>
<ul><li>“Sorry Gregari, I agree with the doctor. You aren't a security specialist, and I don't want you blowing us all to hell! Put that away, and we'll think of something else,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s128.html">(Turn to Section 128)</a></li><li>“Okay Lieutenant.

<p class="P21">Commander's Log Supplemental.</p>
<blockquote>“A number of our human contingent have began showing signs of illness, and Doctor Phisanthi has no idea what might be causing this outbreak. Symptoms include dizzy spells, frequent vomiting, and retching. The Earth representative here issued a plea to a nearby Federation Starbase a moment ago, requesting they send a medical team here with all haste. He fears some dangerous virus or disease is affecting the humans here. So far none of the other races here have been affected by this malady. It appears to be a purely human ailment, and we are saddened to see our human friends being taken ill so suddenly. Doctor Phisanthi will continue to examine the patients being brought in, trying to identify the cause of this illness, but I fear the number of sick is increasing faster than the good doctor can handle. My officers have suggested that perhaps the humans be placed in quarantine until a Federation medical team arrives.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(Cough) (Cough) It is now sixteen hours since the humans began falling ill - and suddenly, whole departments of non-humans have fallen to the sickness as well! It would seem that the onset of this virus comes later for non-human species, and the intensity of the symptoms is far harsher. Six Buvus, eight Cassians, and two Vesarians have died in the last hour, while the humans, though nearly all of them are now quite ill, have yet to suffer any such casualties. There has been some questions among the Cassians about why the humans are not dying from this outbreak. Someone appallingly suggested that anyone who was infected be spaced, to ensure the illness would not continue to spread. Spaced! Things are starting to get out of hand here. We have still received no response from the Federation Starbase as to whether anyone is being sent to help us or not.”</blockquote>

<p>“Come on, Gregari. We need you to scan the water supply,” the commander spoke over his wristcom.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 140)</h2>
<p>Lieutenant Miva Lontira was a Vesarian woman; pale blue-tinted skin, tall and graceful, thin limbed and fragile-looking. She was anything but fragile, as the frail-looking body hid great strength. However, like all Vesarians, she was trained to solve problems using brains, not brawn.</p>
<p>The captain had found her to be wise and very helpful in their dealings with other species and cultures. Many times, her ability to sense the feelings and intentions of others had made for a great advantage.</p>
<p>The counsellor directed her mind and heart towards the space station on the main display screen, and opened herself to the universe.</p>
<p>“Captain, I sense... great fear and confusion. These emotions are coming from the starboard disc of the station. I... I sense nothing at all from the rest of the space station.”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all?” Captain Donaldson asked with surprise. “Are we to assume that all one hundred and forty residents of Pegasi Station are currently cramped into the starboard disc section?”</p>
<p>“Sir,” she felt out towards the station again, “I sense a number of people there, but only perhaps fifty or sixty souls. Certainly no more than one hundred.”</p>
<p>The captain turned to the science officer, who was already pressing buttons on his console. “Confirmed, Captain!” Lieutenant Gregari said worriedly, “I'm only getting life sign readings from the space station's starboard disc.”</p>
<ul><li>“Lieutenant Gregari, other than humans, which species inhabit this station?” the captain asked. <a class="turnToSection" href="s54.html">(Turn to Section 54)</a></li></ul><p></p>
<ul><li>“Ensign Tremane,” the captain ordered the young communications officer, “hail the station, and ask what the current situation is.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s36.html">(Turn to Section 36)</a></li><li>“I think we know enough for now,” the captain decided. “Commander Carlson, put together a Task Group. It's time to pay the station a visit.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s80.html">(Turn to Section 80)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 141)</h2>
<p>“Sounds like a good plan,” Gregari said, looking about uneasily. He would have preferred to remain aboard the ship, but he had known the ever-present dangers of service when he signed up, and would not complain.</p>
<p>Carlson walked over to a wall-mounted console and spoke, “Computer, we wish to go to the starboard disc section.”</p>
<p>“Destination accepted. Please follow the blue lights,” the space station's computer said from a speaker mounted near the console. Above one of the exits, a blue light activated.</p>
<p>The four Task Group members walked through the space station, traversing passageways and chambers of various shapes and sizes, in differing colour schemes that suggested which species had decorated those areas.</p>
<p>The reception chamber was located in the central area of the space station, and blue lights lit up above doorways as they walked, leading them to the starboard disc.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, they reached a large circular bulkhead and hatchway, which provided access to the starboard disc section, where the life signs had been detected.</p>
<p>They found a problem though - the hatch was shut tight!</p>
<ul><li>Carlson examined the console beside the hatch, trying to get the door open. <a class="turnToSection" href="s5.html">(Turn to Section 5)</a></li><li>“Counsellor, can you sense anything on the other side of the door?” Carlson asked the Vesarian empath. <a class="turnToSection" href="s143.html">(Turn to Section 143)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 142)</h2>
<p>Commander Carlson led the way, stepping into the elevator, with the counsellor and science officer close behind. On the way to the Teleportation Chamber, they stopped by Med Bay, and collected Lieutenant Commander Susan Anderson, the ship's Chief Medical Officer.</p>
<p>As they walked down the ship's corridors, other crewmembers of the large starship watched them pass by, filled with admiration for the ship's officers, knowing that the group were heading into a situation from which they might not return.</p>
<p>With the counsellor unable to sense many of the life forms aboard the space station, it was likely that the missing people were dead, killed by the mystery illness. Apparently, it affected non-humans after all. Those still living were likely to be approaching death.</p>
<p>The Task Group stopped by a supply station and put on sealed environmental suits. If it was an airborne virus, or passed through skin contact, the suits would protect them from infection.</p>
<p>If it was something else... Well, there were no answers to be found aboard the <em>Ulysses</em>. They would have to go aboard the space station and find out for themselves.</p>
<p>Each team member collected their chosen equipment, strapping devices onto the utility belts on the outside of the environmental suits.</p>
<p>Then they clipped their wristcoms back on, wearing the thick bracelet devices over the top of their environmental suits. The wristcoms were worn on the left forearm, with a small keypad and a display screen. They were designed mainly for communication, but also served as a personal homing beacon that identified their position. </p>
<p>Lastly, the Task Group stepped into the Teleportation Chamber, and targeted a room inside the space station.</p>
<p><a class="turnToSection" href="s76.html">(Turn to Section 76)</a></p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 143)</h2>
<p>Miva Lontira focused inward, then reached out with her thoughts and her feelings, pushing her mind way beyond the door and into whatever lay beyond.</p>
<p>“There's nothing close to us, but I can feel the presence of the survivors scattered through that section of the station. They feel... weak and faint. I think many will die quite soon. Commander, I sense men, woman, <em>and children</em>. We have to get through to them!”</p>
<p>Carlson jabbed buttons on the console beside the door. The hatch lock mechanism made a few jarring noises, but the hatch would not slide out of the way.</p>
<p>“It won't open!” he said.</p>
<ul><li>“Well, if it's a hatch malfunction, we can find out easily enough.” Carlson turned to the science officer, “Lieutenant Gregari, see if you can access station diagnostics from one of the consoles around here.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s102.html">(Turn to Section 102)</a></li><li>“I guess we could try and shoot our way through,” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s88.html">(Turn to Section 88)</a></li><li>“Lieutenant, can you use a console to override the lock mechanism, and hack the door open?” Carlson asked the science officer. <a class="turnToSection" href="s149.html">(Turn to Section 149)</a></li><li>“Maybe we can find something in this part of the space station that can help us get through? Why don't we look around here some more,” the counsellor suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s62.html">(Turn to Section 62)</a></li><li>“Hey, there's a Detpack on my utility belt. Maybe I could use it to blow a hole in the hatch?” Gregari suggested. <a class="turnToSection" href="s138.html">(Turn to Section 138)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 144)</h2>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari quickly followed suit, leaping at another Cassian soldier, while the two women drew their blasters! However, burdened by the environmental suits, the plan failed miserably.</p>
<p>The commander found himself on the floor, with the enemy officer atop him, bashing at his face with the butt of his energy rifle. As he fell unconscious, he noticed Gregari was also failing in his own fight against a soldier.</p>
<p>The women fired at the third soldier, but at the same time, he shot a bolt of energy into the doctor's chest, sending her flying backwards, crashing onto the deck. The counsellor's blaster shot hit the soldier in return, and he dropped limply to the floor. The counsellor turned to aim her blaster at one of the other soldiers, but the officer who had knocked Carlson unconscious was already turning, bringing up his energy rifle and firing.</p>
<p>The counsellor felt herself flying backwards through the air, a sense of pain and shock ravaging her body, and then, all was dark.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>The Bridge crew watched on the main display screen, as the <em>Sunriser</em> began to turn to face the <em>Ulysses</em> head on.</p>
<p>"Sir, sensors show power building up on the Cassian cruiser!" the helmsman called out.</p>
<p>"Still no word from the Task Group?" the captain asked Ensign Tremane.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sir! We're being jammed by the <em>Sunriser!</em>" she replied, fearfully watching the massive cruiser turning to face them.</p>
<p>The captain stood on the bridge, and said, “Damn-it! We can't leave our people behind! Full power to the shields!”</p>
<p><a class="turnToSection" href="s133.html">(Turn to Section 133)</a></p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 145)</h2>
<p>"We still don't know how they came into contact with the drug," the counsellor pointed out.</p>
<p>"What, you mean we could still end up as sick as them?" Gregari asked worriedly.</p>
<p>"You would have to swallow the chemicals somehow, or be injected by them. Simply touching the chemical compound would have no effect on you, and it can't be received through inhalation," the doctor said.</p>
<p>"Well, these suits are a bit itchy," Gregari complained.</p>
<ul><li>“I think we should keep the suits on, Susan,” Carlson said. “We don't know how the drug got into their bloodstream, and I'd rather not touch, or even smell anything, just to be safe.” <a class="turnToSection" href="s38.html">(Turn to Section 38)</a></li><li>“All right, if you are certain about the drug, then I guess we don't need these suits on,” Carlson agreed with her. <a class="turnToSection" href="s84.html">(Turn to Section 84)</a> </li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 146)</h2>
<p>"Sounds good," Carlson agreed. Turning to a nearby wall console, he said, "Computer, we wish to go to the water supply station."</p>
<p>"Destination confirmed, please follow the red lights," the station's computer said from the wall panel. A red light lit up above a nearby doorway, and they headed through the space station, following more lights as they appeared.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, and going down a few levels, they arrived at the station's water supply station. The chamber was large, with massive water tanks jutting out of the walls, pipes going every-which-way, and other related machinery. Near the entrance were some computer consoles used to control, maintain, and regulate the station's water supply.</p>
<p>"I'll just be a moment," Gregari said, heading over to the consoles.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, he looked back, an annoyed expression on his face. "Someone has tampered with these consoles. I can't get any information from here."</p>
<p>"Damn! What do we do now?" Carlson wondered aloud. For a moment, they all thought about what to do next, then Gregari snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>"Hey, the Control Centre on this space station should be much like the bridge on the <em>Ulysses</em>, right?" he said.</p>
<p>"Of course!" Carlson said. "They should have master command consoles, capable of performing any station functions from there - in case of an emergency."</p>
<p>"I should be able to access the environmental subsystems on one of the command consoles there, let's go!" Gregari said enthusiastically, and they quickly asked the station's computer for directions, and headed off, following the lights. Eventually they rode a lift all the way to the top of the central cylinder structure of the space station, where the dome-like Control Centre protruded from the outer hull of the station.</p>
<p>After the lift's doors slid open, they stepped out onto the Control Centre's deck. The eight non-human officers of Pegasi Station were all there, seated at their posts. Each one of them was very, very dead.</p>
<ul><li>“This is not good... Doctor, Lieutenant Gregari, I think you better scan these bodies as well,” Carlson ordered. <a class="turnToSection" href="s64.html">(Turn to Section 64)</a></li><li>“Let's check the command consoles, and see if these people left any records of their final hours,” Carlson said, striding over to a main console. <a class="turnToSection" href="s120.html">(Turn to Section 120)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 147)</h2>
<p>"Is it all right to leave these people untended," Carlson said hesitantly to the doctor. "You're certain they're going to be okay?"</p>
<p>"I'd stake my reputation on it," she replied.</p>
<p>"All right, let's get Gregari back to the Control Centre," Carlson said. Remembering the way to the Control Centre, they hurried along in their environmental suits, back into the cylindrical centre structure of the station, and up the lift to the top.</p>
<p>Gregari and Doctor Anderson carefully removed a corpse from its seated position at the required control console, and the lieutenant sat down and began to work.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Commander. That's more the sort of thing Blake would be able to do. I wouldn't know where to start,” the science officer said, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Okay, we'll try something else,” Carlson said.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 150)</h2>
<p>As he drew to fire his blaster, one of the Cassian soldiers growled, and pulled his own trigger, shooting a superheated bolt of energy across the deck and through the doctor's chest.</p>
<p>The other Task Group members drew their blasters in shock and rage, returning fire. One of the Cassians went down, but Carlson saw the Counsellor fly backwards from a blaster bolt, and tumble twitching to the deck, beside the doctor.</p>
<p>With incredible speed the other Cassians pounced across the room, hissing like wildcats as they tackled Carlson and Gregari to the floor. As the alien soldier grabbed Carlson's head, and pounded it on the metal deck, Carlson's last waking thought was wishing he could warn the captain, wishing they had succeeded in their mission, and then...</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>"Sir, we still can't open a channel to the Task Group," Ensign Tremane told the captain.</p>
<p>"Sir! The <em>Sunriser</em> is turning to face us - and I read power building up inside of her! She's going to fire!" Lieutenant Lewis called out.</p>
<ul><li>“I hate to leave people behind, but we've got to report the <em>Sunriser's</em> actions to Starbase 14.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 151)</h2>
<p>Leading the way, the commander carefully lifted one suited leg high, and bent his head down, stepping through the large hole in the hatch. On the other side, he looked about, while the others followed him through.</p>
<p>The starboard disc section of the space station was like a large wheel, standing upright. The access hatch from the central cylinder section of the station connected to the starboard disc, right in the middle.</p>
<p>The ten decks in this section were like horizontal slices of the wheel, both above and below them. Each level was smaller than the last, until the top or bottom of the wheel was reached.</p>
<p>At the end of the long corridor were lifts going up or down through the levels. Other corridors led to the rooms on that deck.</p>
<ul><li>“Counsellor, can you direct us to the nearest people?” Carlson asked her. <a class="turnToSection" href="s52.html">(Turn to Section 52)</a></li><li>“Lieutenant Gregari, can you detect any nearby life forms on your science scanner?” Carlson asked him. <a class="turnToSection" href="s19.html">(Turn to Section 19)</a></li></ul>

<p><em>"So you say,"</em> the Cassian said venomously.</p>
<p>"If you contact Starbase 14, you will find the details of our position at that time are on record. I was assigned to this rescue mission by Admiral Branson himself," the captain said.</p>
<p><em>"Another pink-skin human,"</em> the Cassian said, though he did not refute the information.</p>

<p>"Location accepted. Please follow the gold lights," the station's computer responded. A golden light lit up above a nearby door, and they followed similar lights as they made their way through the central section of the space station.</p>
<p>It was eerie walking down silent halls and through lifeless rooms. Everywhere they went were signs of life - active computer consoles, datapads left lying on tables and desktops, and various station equipment lying about as if recently in use. But there were no signs of other life forms in this part of the space station, and the Vesarian Counsellor could detect no life forms outside of the starboard disc structure.</p>
<p>Eventually, they travelled up a lift into the dome-like Control Centre at the top of the central cylinder of the station. What they saw as they stepped out of the lift took everyone's breath away.</p>
<p>They had found the command crew of the space station, and all of the non-human officers of Pegasi Station were there in the Control Centre. They were also very, very dead.</p>
<ul><li>“This is not good... Doctor, Lieutenant Gregari, I think you had better scan these bodies now,” Carlson ordered. <a class="turnToSection" href="s21.html">(Turn to Section 21)</a></li><li>“Let's check the command consoles, and see if these people left any records of their final hours,” Carlson said, striding over to a main console. <a class="turnToSection" href="s152.html">(Turn to Section 152)</a></li></ul>

<p>Lieutenant Lewis pressed a few buttons and said, "Commencing scan, sir!"</p>
<p>An instant later, Ensign Tremane called out, "Sir, we're being hailed."</p>
<p>An image appeared on the main display screen, showing the interior of the <em>Sunriser's</em> Bridge, and the tiger-like face of the ship's captain.</p>
<p><em>"This is Captain Calimbaer of the F.S.S. Sunriser. Our sensors show you have scanned our vessel. I demand to know your intentions! What are you doing here, at Pegasi Station, pink-skin?"</em> the Cassian captain demanded. He sounded arrogant and aggressive, and gave the impression of being openly hostile towards the <em>Ulysses</em> and her crew. Captain Donaldson wondered why the Cassian, who was a fellow member of the Federation of Worlds, and thus an ally, was behaving in this manner.</p>
<p>“We are responding to a distress call made by the humans on this space station. Would you like me to send you the data on our findings, Captain Calimbaer?” Donaldson asked.</p>

<p>“Come off it, Gregari, we're on a short timeframe here,” Carlson said to the young officer.</p>
<p>“Wait, Commander,” Doctor Anderson said, “The lieutenant is probably right – we should make sure we're sealed up properly. The last thing we need is for one of us to get sick, and take whatever it is back with us to the ship!”</p>
<p>The commander thought for a moment, then gave in to her wisdom. Susan was right, and the captain would kill him if they brought the illness back to the crew of the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>“Okay, form a circle. Everyone, check the seals on the suit to your right,” he ordered. </p>
<p>After a few minutes of careful investigation, the counsellor gasped. “Susan, there's a small rip in your environmental suit's leg!”</p>
<p>The doctor gasped too, “Damn! I must have cut my suit on the ragged edge of that hole we blasted through the hatch!”</p>
<p>The commander nearly swore. “Okay, Doctor, what do we do?”</p>
<p>She thought for a while. “We don't yet know how the illness is contracted. It could be by touch, it could be airborne, it could be exposure to some substance we have yet to encounter. We just don't know.</p>
<p>“Commander,” she continued, “I may already be infected. If I can't work out quickly what is wrong with the people here, they'll probably soon die. Worst case, if I'm infected, I'll still be alive for a few hours to find a cure – so I've got nothing to lose by us continuing here.”</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 157)</h2>
<p><em>"I read you, Commander. I'll be there in a few minutes,"</em> Gregari's voice came over their wristcoms.</p>
<p>Commander Carlson and the counsellor surveyed the scene in silence. The faces of many of the bodies were contorted in agony. It must not have been a pleasant death - if any death could ever be called pleasant.</p>
<p>The lift doors swooshed open, and the science officer stepped out onto the deck of the Control Centre. He took a horrified look at the corpses, and looked like he might throw up, then he steeled himself for duty, and began scanning the bodies with his hand-held science scanner.</p>
<p>"Sir," he turned to the commander, "my science scanner can't identify the exact cause of death. I'd say they were poisoned, but can't be certain. I think they might have been exposed to the drug that Doctor Anderson said the humans had in them, but I would need a medical scanner to be certain."</p>
<p>Carlson sighed, and pressed the button on his wristcom again, "Susan, looks like we need you up here too. We've got some non-humans who may have died as a result of the drug you were talking about."</p>
<p><em>"Killed? I suppose... it wasn't tested on non-humans. They may have died as a result of the drug. I'll be there in a minute. I haven't found any signs of Bihosanzamene here in the Med Bay,"</em> Doctor Anderson's voice came over their wristcoms.</p>
<p>Minutes later, she too arrived, and got to work examining the eight corpses. There were no humans here, but there were a number of short, stocky Buvus, two feline Cassians, and the corpse of a Vesarian. It only took a brief scan of the bodies to confirm the fear growing in Doctor Anderson's mind.</p>
<p>"Commander, they all have Bihosanzamene in their systems, just like the ill humans," she told him. "But the drug was never tested outside of Earth! It appears that while the drug has temporary harmful affects on humans that ingest it, the substance is quite fatal to alien physiology. These Buvus, the two Cassians over there, and that Vesarian officer have reacted to the drug as though lethally poisoned by it."</p>
<p>"That's why I could not detect any other life signs!" Counsellor Lontira said, visibly appalled. "Everyone else on this space station, all the non-human residents, are dead!"</p>
<p>"How did this happen? Who would do such a monstrous thing?" Gregari asked angrily.</p>
<p>“I better tell the captain what we've found out here,” Carlson said, pressing a button on his wristcom.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 158)</h2>
<p>"Sir," Blake said, "They are obviously hostile! He sounded more like a renegade than a Federation officer. I say we open fire while their shields are still down, and disable their vessel! They might be more open to discussion when we have the upper hand!"</p>
<p>"You can't be serious!" Ensign Hobb, the navigator, said. "That's a military cruiser! They'd probably blow us away before we did any real harm to them."</p>
<p>"What do you suggest, Ensign?" the captain asked him.</p>
<p>"I... I don't know, sir, but firing on them would definitely be an act of war, and so far they can't prove we've done anything wrong," Ensign Hobb answered.</p>
<p>"What about you, Lieutenant Lewis?" Captain Donaldson asked the helmsman.</p>
<p>"They out-gun us five to one, sir. But... if their shields are down, we'd have a good opportunity for a first strike. Maybe we could target some vital systems, and hit them hard before they retaliated. I don't know... if we could prove we were not involved in the poisoning aboard the space station, they'd have to listen to us, sir," Lieutenant Lewis said.</p>
<ul><li>“Okay, Blake. We'll try to disable them before they are able to destroy us. Helmsman, target their generators, and fire on my mark!” Captain Donaldson ordered. <a class="turnToSection" href="s160.html">(Turn to Section 160)</a></li><li>“Ensign Tremane, open a channel to the Task Group.

<h2>(Section &mdash; 159)</h2>
<p>"At least we know what happened to the non-humans aboard the space station," Gregari commented with a gulp. The bodies were those of the non-human officers that ran the space station. There were some of the short, stocky Buvus, some feline Cassians, and some Vesarian corpses that the counsellor tried to avoid looking at.</p>
<p>"That explains why you sensed life in the starboard disc section, and nothing in the rest of the station," Carlson said to the counsellor, as the doctor and science officer analysed the bodies. Then he turned to the others, "Be careful, and don’t cut your suits. The last thing we need is for one of us to catch whatever killed them."</p>
<p>After a few moments, Doctor Anderson stood up from where she had knelt beside a dead Buvu. "Commander, I... I think I may have an idea of what happened here - but before I discuss it further, I'll need to analyse one of the ill humans aboard this station."</p>
<p>"If you have an idea, Doctor, I'd like to hear it," he replied.</p>
<p>"Unless I have evidence to support my theory, I will not disclose it. I need to look at the others aboard this station, Commander," she said. Carlson felt anger rising inside of him, but the counsellor placed a calming hand on his shoulder, and he knew arguing wouldn't help.</p>
<p>"Okay, Gregari, you said you could override the locked hatch from here? Get to it," he ordered.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Gregari and the doctor carefully removed a dead Buvu from in front of the required console, then Gregari got down to work. A few minutes later, he turned to them with a grim smile. "I've done it. Let's get down there, it should be open now."</p>
<ul><li>“Hang on, we should see if we can access the final log entries. Perhaps we could learn more on what happened here,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s92.html">(Turn to Section 92)</a></li><li>“All right, let's head back to the hatchway. We should be able to reach the survivors and find out what is wrong with them,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s162.html">(Turn to Section 162)</a></li></ul>
<h2>(Section &mdash; 160)</h2>
<p>The Captain stood, looking at the main display screen, watching the hostile Cassian cruiser. At any instant, the ship, which was treating them like an enemy, could open fire and obliterate the <em>Ulysses</em>. </p>
<p>No, Blake was right. It was best to strike first. If they could just disable the Cassian cruiser, they would have no choice but to talk, and listen to Captain Donaldson. They could straighten this mess out without unnecessary deaths.</p>
<p>"Fire!" he ordered.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Lewis activated the weapon pods, launching torrents of energy through space in streaks of massive, artificial lightning. </p>
<p>The energy blasts smashed into the targeted areas of the Cassian cruiser, but its military grade energy shield shrugged off most of the damage.</p>
<p>Suddenly, golden streams of superheated light struck out from the Cassian cruiser, lashing back at the <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
<p>"They're returning fire!" Lieutenant Lewis shouted with fear.</p>
<p>"Shields at fifty percent, and falling, sir!" the helmsman called out.</p>
<p>There was no real choice now. If he could not disable the Cassian cruiser, they would all be dead.</p>
<p>"Fire again!" the captain ordered. Again, the <em>Ulysses</em> launched streams of energy at the Cassian cruiser. This time, the enemy's shields began to fail, and some hull fragments could be seen tearing away from the surface of the military ship.</p>
<p>It was not enough.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunriser</em> fired on the <em>Ulysses</em> again. For a few seconds, the Bridge crew watched multiple streams of superheated energy lashing out at them, showing on the display screen. And then it was over.</p>
<p>In an explosion that rocked the nearby space station, the <em>Ulysses</em> broke apart, and their mission came to a violent and abrupt ending.</p>
<p>Your adventures end here.</p>

<h2>(Section &mdash; 161)</h2>
<p>"It was just an idea," Gregari said defensively.</p>
<p>"A wise decision, Commander," Counsellor Lontira said.</p>
<p>"Then how are we going to get past the hatch into the starboard disc section?" the doctor asked.</p>
<p>“Hey, if I could access the maintenance command console in the station's Control Centre, I might be able to override the locking mechanism on the hatch!” Gregari suggested.</p>

<p>"Computer, we want to go to the starboard disc section of the station," he told a nearby console. The lift door opened as the station's computer answered, "Destination confirmed. Please follow the green lights."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, after a trip down the lift, and a hurried walk in their lumbering environmental suits, they reached the hatchway area again. This time the hatch was open, beckoning them forwards. </p>
<ul><li>“Counsellor, can you direct us to the nearest people?” Carlson asked. <a class="turnToSection" href="s40.html">(Turn to Section 40)</a></li><li>“Lieutenant Gregari, scan for the nearest life forms,” Carlson said. <a class="turnToSection" href="s28.html">(Turn to Section 28)</a></li></ul>

<p>The captain quickly signalled the ensign to cut off the communications, then said, “Okay people, what are your thoughts on this situation?”</p>

<p>Commander Carlson tapped a button on his wristcom, and spoke into the microphone inside his environmental suit's helmet, "Task Group to <em>Ulysses</em>: Captain, we've got some welcome news over here. Doctor Anderson was able to identify the cause of the mystery illness. I'll let her fill you in."</p>
<p>"This is Doctor Anderson," she said into her wristcom. "Captain, somehow these people have been exposed to an experimental drug, a medicine that was a failure and cancelled back on Earth. All of the symptoms of their mysterious illness are simply the negative side effects of taking the medication. The good news is that the traces of the chemical compounds are fading from their bloodstreams, and in another twenty-four hours, they'll all be good and healthy again. The station's doctors would not have picked up on the problem because the development of the drug in question was kept under wraps after it was established as a failure."</p>
<p>The Captain's voice spoke from their wristcoms, <em>"That's good news, people! We were starting to get worried over here. Well done, Doctor!"</em></p>
<ul><li><em>“However, I'm curious, Doctor,”</em> Captain Donaldson said. <em>“If this medicine was cancelled, and not in use, how is it you were able to recognise it?”</em> <a class="turnToSection" href="s118.html">(Turn to Section 118)</a></li><li><em>“So, have you looked at anything else aboard the station?

<p>"Raising shields in increments of ten," the security chief replied.</p>
<p>A few moments later, Ensign Tremane turned to the captain, "Sir! We're being hailed by the <em>Sunriser!</em>"</p>
<p>"On screen, Ensign," the captain ordered. The face of the Cassian military captain returned to the screen, now scowling in open displeasure.</p>
<p><em>"Ulysses, you have raised your shields. Why would you need to do this in the presence of an ally? You have something to hide! You are obviously involved in the deaths aboard Pegasi Station. Our scans show that all the humans aboard the station still live - what did you do to the non-humans aboard this station?"</em> the feline captain demanded.</p>
<p>“I assure you, Captain Calimbaer, we had nothing to do with this tragedy. Our scans showed that a drug was used to poison the station’s inhabitants, and even the humans fell sick to this. We came here in response to their call for aid,” Donaldson said.</p>

<p><em>"I'll be there as fast as I can!"</em> Doctor Anderson replied.</p>
<p><em>"Bodies?"</em> Lieutenant Gregari's voice came over the wristcoms, <em>"That doesn't sound good."</em></p>
<p>"Have you found the water supply station yet?" Carlson asked.</p>
<p><em>"Just arrived there. It'll take a few minutes to scan the place," </em>the lieutenant replied.</p>
<p>"Okay. Keep me informed," Carlson ordered.</p>
<p>The lift doors opened again, and the doctor stepped out. Her face went white as she looked upon the Buvu, Cassian and Vesarian corpses sitting dead at their stations. Drawing her hand-held medical scanner, she began to work her way around the room, examining the bodies. The more she looked at them, the more concerned she appeared to be.</p>
<p>"I sense your distress," the counsellor said. "What is it, Doctor?"</p>
<p>"Bihosanzamene. All of them have it in their systems, just like the humans did. The only thing is, it seems that the chemical compound is lethal to non-human life forms. I didn't know. The drug was never tested outside of Earth, so its side effects outside of humanity were never examined," Doctor Anderson said.</p>
<p>"So... it looks like everyone in the station was probably exposed to the drug. The humans will be okay in another twenty-four hours or so, but everyone else is probably dead. This is not good," Carlson said.</p>

<p>"I agree, we're allies here, both members of the Federation of Worlds. There's no need to raise shields, because no fighting will be taking place this day. Not if we can help it," the captain said.</p>
<p>"Ah, sir... You might be interested in these sensor readings," Lieutenant Lewis said nervously.</p>
<p>"What is it, Lieutenant?" Captain Donaldson asked.</p>
<p>"The Cassians, sir, have just teleported three people aboard Pegasi Station. It looks like the captain meant what he said about looking into the matter themselves."</p>

<p><strong>Meanwhile, aboard the Ulysses...</strong></p>
<p>"I wonder what the <em>Sunriser</em> is doing out here, at Pegasi Station," Captain Donaldson mused.</p>
<p>The Cassian military cruiser had come to a halt a thousand spatials from the <em>Ulysses</em>, and simply sat there in space doing nothing. There had been no communications from the starship, and for some reason, that made the captain feel very uneasy.</p>
<p>The feline Cassians were one of the six major species that made the Federation of Worlds. So, they were allies of humanity, and the starship <em>Ulysses</em>. Yet, the standoff position, the silence - it was an aggressive posture, not one of an ally lending their aid. It simply made no sense...</p>

<p><em>"What in blazes happened?"</em> the captain asked.</p>
<p>"We've found traces of the same dangerous drug in their bloodstreams. It seems that to Buvus, Cassians and Vesarians, the chemical compound is lethal," Carlson explained.</p>
