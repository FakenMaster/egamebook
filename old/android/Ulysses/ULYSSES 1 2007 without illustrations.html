For over a hundred years, the six major species (those capable of interstellar travel) have lived in relative peace.</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">The <span class="T2">F.S.S. Ulysses</span> is a human starship of the Federation Stellar Services, designed to carry out non-military roles, such as scientific exploration, providing medical aid, and performing diplomatic duties. However, the crew have been called to aid the military branch of the Federation Stellar Services on numerous occasions in the past, and while not as heavily armed or armoured as a military cruiser, her twin starship-scale particle cannons still pack quite a punch.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The story so far:</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">A distress call was received at Starbase 14 from Pegasi Station, a mixed-species space station located in Sector 17. All the humans aboard Pegasi Station had fallen ill with a mysterious virus, and the starship <span class="T2">Ulysses</span> was quickly dispatched to examine the situation, and hopefully to develop a cure – before the humans died.</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">At the time of the distress call, the non-humans (aliens) at the space station all seemed to be in fine health, and Federation High Command was worried that someone might have created a virus that targeted humans only – a bio-weapon that could threaten the entire human race!</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">The <span class="T2">Ulysses</span> was around twenty-four hours away from the space station when the new orders came in, but it was the closest ship. They had orders to reach the space station with all due haste, and they hoped that when they arrived, the humans would still be alive.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">How to read this gamebook:</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">In this gamebook, instead of playing a single character, you decide how numerous characters in the story will react to the situations they are faced with. You will be presented with options of things people say or do, and the story will move forward according to the options you choose.</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Instead of reading this page-by-page as you would read a novel, each option you can choose tells you to turn to a certain paragraph section of the book to continue the story.</p><p class="P22">For example:</p><ul><li><p class="Last_20_Option" style="margin-left:0cm;"><span class="WW8Num2z0" style="display:block;float:left;min-width:0cm;">●.</span>Security Chief Blake Thomas shouted, “We should attack them now, Captain!” (<span class="T2">Turn to Section - 7)</span><span class="odfLiEnd"/> </p></li></ul><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">As you look through the book, you will see section numbers in bold text. For example, section eight would be shown as <span class="T4">(Section - 8)</span>. Simply choose the path you wish the story to take, and flip through the book to find the section it referred you to, and continue reading from there.</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">As the story unfolds, you will determine how the crew handles the situations they are faced with, and ultimately, whether they succeed or fail.</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">Lastly, unlike many gamebooks, you do not require a pencil or piece of paper to keep track of information. However, while playing this adventure, you might be asked to remember something simple.</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">This will rarely happen, but if you come across it, and you feel you cannot remember it, write it down on a scrap of paper. In such cases, you will be given two options later on, asking if you did, or did not perform a certain action. Each option will refer you to a different section of the story to continue.</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">You can learn more about the main characters aboard the <span class="T2">Ulysses</span> by reading the next section, <span class="T2">Section - 2</span>.

He is a male human of average height, balding, with a close-trimmed goatee and moustache. His hair is dark brown, beginning to show streaks of grey. This is his second captaincy, his first being aboard the <span class="T2">F.S.S. Endeavour</span> for eight years.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The First Officer:</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Commander Evan Carlson is a human male, in his mid-thirties, and served with Captain Donaldson aboard the <span class="T2">F.S.S.

The captain was so impressed with him that he made a request to have the commander reassigned aboard the <span class="T2">Ulysses</span> before its maiden voyage.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The Chief of Security:</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">Lieutenant Commander Blake Thomas is a human male, in his mid-thirties. He is skilled in many forms of combat, from unarmed, martial arts duelling, to heavy weapons and demolitions devices. He also shares the starship's weapon systems with Lieutenant Lewis, the ship's Chief Helmsman. </p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">While he will obey any superior's orders without question, Captain Donaldson has noted Blake's tendency to fight first, and ask questions later. The captain hopes that aboard a non-military starship, in peaceful sectors of space, Blake will learn that sometimes the right words can negate hostilities before fighting becomes necessary.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The Chief Engineer:</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Lieutenant Commander Terrance Idato is a quiet, thoughtful human male, aged in his late thirties. He is more at home among machinery, computers and electronic devices than among his fellow crewmates, but without his skilled mind and hands, it would be impossible to keep the four-hundred-and-forty-metre long starship in top shape.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The Chief Medical Officer:</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Lieutenant Commander Susan Anderson, usually just called Doctor Anderson, heads the medical teams aboard the starship <span class="T2">Ulysses</span>.

Doctor Anderson has a powerful intellect, and has taken part in the development of numerous beneficial medical discoveries over the last fifteen years.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The Counsellor:</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">Lieutenant Miva Lontira is a female Vesarian, an empathic humanoid species capable of sensing the emotions and intentions of other people. Vesarians were the first species humanity encountered as they began travelling to the stars, and the more advanced Vesarians took on a role of advisers and counsellors to the human race. </p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Most human starships have a Vesarian aboard in the position of ship's counsellor, aiding humans in their dealings with other beings they encounter.</p><p class="P22">The Chief Science Officer:</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Lieutenant Johan Gregari is a human male in his mid-twenties. He holds a fascination with anything that has yet to be understood by mankind. Lieutenant Gregari has a good understanding of the alien species that are part of the Federation of Worlds, and spends his time learning more about alien technologies and sciences.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The Chief Helmsman:</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Lieutenant Michael Lewis is a human male, in his mid-twenties. He pilots the starship, and shares the operation of ship's weapon systems with Blake, the Chief of Security.</p><p class="paragraph_20_heading">The Chief Navigator:</p><p class="Last_20_Paragraph">Ensign Robert Hobb is a human male, aged in his early twenties, and is in charge of ship navigation.

"It was a failed medicine - an experiment that resulted in the banning of the chemical substance. It was supposed to help treat solar radiation sickness, and while it did have some beneficial effects, its side effects can be seen before us: overwhelming nausea, blackouts, dizzy spells, vomiting – all very unpleasant. However, the human body naturally resists the drug, and after a patient stops using Bihosanzamene, it goes out of their system within two days, leaving them as healthy as they were before taking the drug."</p><p class="Main_20_Paragraph">"Let me get this straight, Susan," Carlson said.
