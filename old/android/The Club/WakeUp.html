<h1>Chapter 1: Morning Lemon</h1>
<h2>The Waking Up</h2>

<p>You are dreaming about a little stream in the forest that gradually grows into a full, bleary river and then you notice a person on the other bank. The person is drinking from the river and grows with it. He's becoming bigger and stronger &mdash; but also older &mdash; with each sip he takes. He's standing now, his head way above the clouds. He could easily overstep the river. But he doesn't, he's just standing there, looking down at you through openings in the clouds.</p> 

<p>Then he suddenly stamps with both his feet. Ka-BOOM! The ground shakes and you wake up instantly.</p>

<p>In the real world, in your bedroom, three things are happening at the same time. First, there are little pieces of chipboard way up in the air, descending to the floor as your eyes are opening. They appear to have been propelled from a fist sized crater in your bed's framing that surely wasn't there when you went to sleep last night. Second, miniature pieces of shattered glass spray your bed and its surroundings. Some of them cut through the flesh of you face and leave little scars that would later fill with drops of blood. Third, one of your bedroom's windows starts to disintegrate, breaking up into triangular planes that fall with bizzare slowness to the ground.</p>

Then, _after_ you see all this, you hear a distant gunshot. Then its echo. Then its echo's echo. Then your mobile phone starts ringing.

<p>You have a feeling you were very, very lucky just a second ago.</p>

<p>A sudden adrenaline rush makes your mind crystal clear and your physical movement much quicker than it would normally be so early in the morning. What do you do?</p>

<ul>
	<li>"Stay in bed":StayInBed.html and hope it's just a bad, bad dream.</li>
	<li>"Quickly roll over to the left":Corner.html, out of the bed and to the floor, where the phone is ringing.</li>
	<li>"Quickly roll over to the right":BelowTheWindow.html, out of the bed and below the window that's falling apart.</li>
</ul>
