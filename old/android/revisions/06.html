<p align="justify">Despite an unsettling feeling, you start moving forward again. In the back of your mind, you can picture Hank being killed horrifically. What must that be like, being burned alive? Did Hank die in agony? These thoughts become too appalling. Hank deserved a better ending than that. In order to keep your sanity, you try to block out these disturbing thoughts. It is infinitely more productive to focus on your running. You must escape, but your body aches. Just how big is this place? Running can be great exercise, but this trek is slowly killing you. You’re unable to distinguish what’s dripping from your forehead. Is it blood or is it sweat? Your vision is becoming blurred. Every new hallway seems the same as the last. Disorientated, you are losing the ability to continue. The scientist realizes the difficulty that you are having. He stops to help you move. The scientist speaks reassuring words. He says, “It’s just around the corner.”</p>
<p align="justify">You are dying here. Does he really think you can be motivated any further? You look at the scientist with blurry eyes. You may be too tired to speak, but your expression reads loud and clear. You want to know if he’s serious. You simply cannot keep this up indefinitely. The scientist understands your situation. As he physically helps you to move, the scientist points to an overhead sign. With an arrow pointing to the right, it show the way to the hangar entrance. The scientist says, “See... we’re almost there.”</p>
<p align="justify">Apparently, your means of escape is via an expensive military aircraft. Knowing that you are close to the hangar entrance is reassuring. Although, another sign catches your attention. You spot a radiation-warning symbol. It doesn’t take much deduction to draw the next logical conclusion. These planes are packing weapons of mass destruction. The scientist wasn’t kidding. He really is going to blow the place up. It is not clear why this troubles the scientist so greatly. Maybe if the structure wasn’t a smoldering heap, and maybe if all of your allies weren’t already dead, there might be a greater sense of loss. What’s the big deal? Razing an already ravaged rock pile gives you little reason to regret.</p>
<p align="justify">For some reason unknown to you, the scientist does feel remorse. As you make your final steps towards the hangar, the scientist explains the situation. “Nuclear weapons should never be used to solve problems, but that’s precisely what I’m doing. You may not be aware of this, but there are 150,000 civilians within a 10-mile radius of this facility. No matter which direction the wind blows, all too many of them will be caught in the fallout. I will be responsible for their deaths.”</p>
<p align="justify">As the scientist tells you this grim news, he is helping you to move onward. You don’t know if you hold any importance to the mission, yet the scientist is still fighting to keep you alive. It is hard to imagine what your role could be in this mess. You’re essentially a burden. Despite your condition, the scientist refuses to abandon you. The scientist is not a physical powerhouse, but he struggles to help you continue. You sense great compassion in this man. The fact that thousands of innocent people will die by his doing, that must be tearing him up inside. What is really going on here? Why would such a benevolent man harm civilians? The scientist continues speaking, “Unfortunately, this is the only way. The secrets stored here are unimaginable. Take your wildest science fiction novel. We’ve made it reality. With the base now compromised, the information kept here must be destroyed. All the documents, all the data, everything must be obliterated. The material in these labs cannot fall into the wrong hands. Far more lives would be lost or even worse… all of humanity could simply cease to exist.”</p>
<p align="justify">What does he mean by that? What could be here that would cause the end of the human race? With your weight leaning on the Captain, the two of you turn the final corner. There it is - the underground entrance to the hangar. A mere 75-foot hallway is what stands between you and freedom from this place. The scientist continues explaining the situation. “Since I could walk, I wanted to know the answers to life’s greatest questions. Who are we? Why are we here? What’s the meaning of life? This desire for knowledge burned within me. It drove me to the intense study of science. I believed that every mystery in life had a logical explanation, if you looked for it hard enough. That’s exactly why this facility was created - to find those answers. In the path for true enlightenment, we were opening the door to new discoveries. The breakthroughs we revealed were remarkable. It would forever change every aspect of life - war, agriculture, health, and even time. We used to joke that we had slain the four horsemen. It was believed that civilization could forever live in peace. When we unlocked the secrets of life, it was as if nature tried to balance itself. We unlocked something evil. Now that I know what I know, the only thing I want is to forget.”</p>
<p align="justify">The scientist guides your body to the nearest wall. He says, “Wait here just a second, while I open the door.”</p>
<p align="justify">You lean against the wall. While slowly trying to catch your breath, you’re losing the ability to keep your eyes open. You feel a tremendous urge to rest. Maybe if you close your eyes for just a second you’ll be OK. Yah, it would only be for just a second. That wouldn’t hurt… must… rest… eyes. You try to shake this feeling off, but you just can’t. Your eyes are dry and irritated. With each blink, the shutting of your eyes feels more pleasurable. Eventually, you give in. You close your eyes. That does feel good, doesn’t it? You can almost float away and forget all this misery. Maybe this is all just a bad dream.</p>
<p align="justify">You’re not going to get too comfortable while standing up. This leaves you somewhat anchored in reality. You can hear the scientist pounding away at the hanger terminal. This isn’t going to be like your previous encounter with a door. He’s already got this one opening. You know it will soon be time for you to get moving again. Will you be able to open your eyes? That’s not your concern right now. You’re enjoying the solace of the moment.</p>
<p align="justify">There’s time for a quick nap. What would you like to dream about?</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">A) <a href="06-a.html">Something romantic</a> </strong>- You want a passionate dream, one where you are loved and caressed.</p>
<p align="justify">B) <a href="06-b.html">Something relaxing</a> </strong>- You want something that will calm you down. You’ve had a rough day.</p>
<p align="justify">C) <a href="06-c.html">Something adventurous</a> </strong>- Your weakened state has you longing for the role of a hero.</p>
<p align="justify">D) <a href="06-d.html">Something abstract</a> </strong>- Dreams seldom make sense. Why should now be any different?</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Be careful now. Even dreaming has its dangers. This is no bonus stage. You can make a wrong choice here. Although, the result is based purely on luck. At least the odds are with you. There’s a 75% chance of success. Oh, there’s one other thing. One of the correct choices is worth double the points. Can you guess the right one?</p>
