You almost feel sympathy for these mindless monsters, as they wonâ€™t know what hit them. For once, you have the tactical advantage.</p>
<p align="justify">Jumping high into the air, while letting out a deafening battle cry, you are ready to engage the unsuspecting Earth Elementals. Upon your decent, you swing both your maces.

Surrounded by these rock creatures, you open up with a flurry of attacks. You shatter your enemies, one after the other.</p>
