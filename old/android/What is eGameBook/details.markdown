# Design of the eGameBook app

Did I mention that you are awesome? Because you are. You want to know more about the concept behind eGameBook and that alone says "awesome" like nothing else.

**The core idea** of eGameBook is that mobile phones are the future of gamebooks and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories â€“ and a bright future at that. We've already played a couple of CYOA stories using the early versions of eGameBook and we absolutely *loved*
the experience. That's when we realized that what the world needs right now is an offline gamebook app for mobile phones.

The main technology that will be used for writing the gamebooks is **good ol' HTML + JavaScript**. HTML is still the best and most common way to create hypertext &mdash; and gamebooks are exactly that. But we're not planning to stop there. Thanks to a JavaScript API, the stories' authors will be able to store data (inventory, story status, XP points and such) and present them in a user friendly manner. That means dynamic text, more interaction, resolving fights, even animations. And again, JavaScript is the most common scripting language there is right now ([research](http://www.cio.com/article/446829/PHP_JavaScript_Ruby_Perl_Python_and_Tcl_Today_The_State_of_the_Scripting_Universe?contentId=446829&amp;slug=&amp)).

There is **no business model behind the app**, and we plan to keep it free. It's just a fan project right now &mdash; bringing together our love for gamebooks *and* the Android platform. On the other hand, we believe that **great writers deserve to get paid for their work**. This means that in the future, we might charge users for playing the best adventures and give the revenue back to the authors. But that's still a long way to go.

**If you are a writer**, and if you want to make your existing or future story published in eGameBook, [please contact us](contact.html)! Even better: send us the story in a document or &mdash; better still &mdash; in HTML. We will take care of the conversion for you. (In the future, it will be possible to add stories by your own.)

Now you can **start browsing the available stories** by pressing the Back button on your Android device. (This thing you're reading right now is also &mdash; technically &mdash; a story. We just took the liberty to lead you here by default, since it appears to be the first time you opened the application.)
