# Contact eGameBook

You can always reach us using email ([filip@egamebook.com](mailto:filip@egamebook.com)) and of course by leaving comments (and preferrably also good ratings!) on the Market.

We will be thrilled to hear from you!

Now you can **start browsing the available stories** by pressing the Back button on your Android device. (This thing you're reading right now is also &mdash; technically &mdash; a story. We just took the liberty to lead you here by default, since it appears to be the first time you opened the application.) 

Or [click here](index.html) to get to the start page.
