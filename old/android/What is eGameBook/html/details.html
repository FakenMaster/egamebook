<h1>Design of the eGameBook app</h1>
<p>Did I mention that you are awesome? Because you are. You want to know more about the concept behind eGameBook and that alone says "awesome" like nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>The core idea</strong> of eGameBook is that mobile phones are the future of gamebooks and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure stories  and a bright future at that. We've already played a couple of CYOA stories using the early versions of eGameBook and we absolutely <em>loved</em>
the experience. That's when we realized that what the world needs right now is an offline gamebook app for mobile phones.</p>
<p>The main technology that will be used for writing the gamebooks is <strong>good ol' HTML + JavaScript</strong>. HTML is still the best and most common way to create hypertext &mdash; and gamebooks are exactly that. They're hypertext (even though they started in book form). But we're not planning to stop there. Thanks to a JavaScript API, the stories' authors will be able to store data (inventory, story status, XP points and such) and present them in a user friendly manner. That means dynamic text, more interaction, resolving fights, even animations. And again, JavaScript might be the most common scripting language there is right now.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no business model behind the app</strong>, and we plan to keep it free. It's just a fan project right now &mdash; bringing together our love for gamebooks <em>and</em> the Android platform. On the other hand, we believe that <strong>great writers deserve to get paid for their work</strong>. This means that in the future, we might charge users for playing the best adventures and give the revenue back to the authors. But that's a long way to go.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a writer</strong>, and if you want to make your existing or future story published in eGameBook, <a href="contact.html">please contact us</a>! Even better: send us the story in a document or &mdash; better still &mdash; in HTML. We will take care of the conversion for you. (In the future, it will be possible to add stories by your own.)</p>
<p>Now you can <strong>start browsing the available stories</strong> by pressing the Back button on your Android device. (This thing you're reading right now is also &mdash; technically &mdash; a story. We just took the liberty to lead you here by default, since it appears to be the first time you opened the application.) </p>
