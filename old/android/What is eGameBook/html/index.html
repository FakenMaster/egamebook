<h1>You. Are. Awesome.</h1>
<p>Thank you for downloading <strong>eGameBook</strong>! This application strives to bring gamebooks and Choose-Your-Own-Adventures to the Android platform, while giving talented writers a way to publish their work.</p>
<p><a href="details.html">Touch me here</a> if you want to know the details of our design. (Writing gamebooks is super easy!)</p>
<p>This public beta is just the beginning. We're supporting only the most basic adventures right now, but we have big plans. Oh yes we have! And we'd like <em>you</em> to take part in designing the application and making it great.</p>
<p>Please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> if you</p>
<ul>
<li>have an interactive story to share,</li>
<li>dislike anything about the current design,</li>
<li>have an interesting idea for development,</li>
<li>or need anything else.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can <strong>start browsing the available stories</strong> by pressing the Back button on your Android device. (This thing you're reading right now is also &mdash; technically &mdash; a story. We just took the liberty to lead you here by default, since it appears to be the first time you opened the application.)</p>
