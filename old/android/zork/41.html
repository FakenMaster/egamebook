<P>
Leaving the hut behind them, Bivotar and Juranda wade the shallow stream
and cross the cavern. At the far end of the cavern, a dark opening leads to
another passage.
</P>
<P>
They enter this new tunnel. The ground here is made of soft sand, slowing
their progress.
</P>
<P>
After walking a while, they come to a point where the passage widens to
form a small round room. In the center of the room, painted right onto the
sandy floor, is a red "X".
</P>
<P>
" 'X' marks the spot," says Bivotar with a grin.
</P>
<P>
"What do you mean?"
</P>
<P>
"Try digging there with the shovel."
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Biv. What would that accomplish?"
</P>
<P>
"Who knows? It won't hurt to try."
</P>
<P>
"It'll just be a waste of time."
