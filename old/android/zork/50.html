They proceed along the passageway. Here and there, smaller passages branch
off to the side. The walls of the passage are black and lumpy. At various

its four wheels mounted on the track. Most of the car is a large bin, filled
with coal.

room beyond. The room seems out of place here in the coal mine,
especially its white polished granite walls.

machine.
