"Well, yeah, okay," says Bivotar, looking longingly back at the trunk
filled with emeralds and sapphires. "Who needs jewels and stuff
anyway, right?"
</P>

They follow the main passage for a long time. At one point, they
surprise a family of bats, which go flying down the tunnel and disappear.
Other than that, their travel is without incident, and they begin to
get very bored and tired. Finally, they see a junction of some kind
ahead. They reach the interesting corridor, which is much smaller and
narrower.
</P>
<P>
To the left, the small corridor ends almost immediately. Just before this
dead end, a dark hole leads downward. A rope, tied to a nearby rock,
dangles into the hole. Sinister gurgling noises can be heard from
below.
</P>
<P>
To the right, the passage continues beyond the range of the lantern.
However, the ground in that direction is strewn with bones.
</P>
<P>
Straight ahead is a metal gate, blocking off the main passage. Just
behind the gate, sound asleep, is a hairy gnome. He is very fat, and the
remains of a half-eaten meal lie strewn about him.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a massive stone door descends from the ceiling just behind them
and crashes shut. Echoes from the crash reverberate throughout down
the tunnels. The gnome wakens instantly, and jumps to his feet.
</P>
<P>
"Ahah! Travelers!" begins the gnome, with an artificial smile. "There
hasn't been much traffic recently. I suppose you'll be wanting to
come through the gate here?"
</P>
<P>
"Why yes, we would," answers Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"I hope you're prepared to pay the toll," says the gnome, still smiling.
</P>
<P>
"What sort of toll?" asks Juranda, suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
"Oh nothing much. A bauble. Actually, at this particular point in
time, I'm feeling particularly fond of rubies."

<I>Did you find the ruby? <A HREF="66.html">If so...</A>

<P>
If not, you will have to try one of the two side passages.
