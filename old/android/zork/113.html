"On second thought, why don't we go back along the same route?" says
Bivotar. "At least we're familiar with it."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar, Juranda, and Grum return to the Cavern of the Rainbow
Mosses, and begin winding their way through the maze of stone figures
again. Before they have crossed the cavern, however, a cold wind sweeps
around them, and the amulet begins to glow. A moment later,
an incredibly old man appears. He is wrinkled and stooped, and is dressed
in a robe of midnight blue. Atop his head is an almost comical-looking
pointed cap decorated with stars. He seems harmless enough.
</P>
<P>
Then the old man speaks, in a powerful and malevolent voice that
belies his innocent appearance. "At last I have found the thieves who
ransacked my workshop! I will have to teach you that no one trifles
with Grawl." He produces a wand from his robe and points it at Bivotar
and Juranda, who turn into beetles. Grawl proceeds to crush them under
his heel.
