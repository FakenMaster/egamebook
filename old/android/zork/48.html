Juranda shrugs and hands the shovel to Bivotar. He immediately begins digging
into the sand at the center of the "X."
</P>
<P>
"You're just wasting time," Juranda complains.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar digs the hole deeper. The sand keeps sliding back into the hole, making
his work difficult. Juranda whistles a tune.
</P>
<P>
"Had enough yet?" Juranda asks, several minutes later.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I guess so," says Bivotar smiling. "I don't think I'll find anything besides
this." He holds up a giant ruby, still covered with wet sand.
</P>
<P>
"Gosh! You were right, Biv. Wow!"
</P>
<P>
"Okay." Bivotar cleans the sand off the ruby and stows it in his pack. "Let's
get going."
</P>
<P>
"Wait!" says Juranda. "Let's keep digging! There might be more rubies or there
might..." She trails off, looking extremely embarrassed at her greedy outburst.
"Yup, let's get going."
</P>
<P>
They proceed along the passageway. Here and there, smaller passages branch
off to the side. The walls of the passage are black and lumpy. At various
points, wooden beams have been erected to support the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
The passageway widens, and they notice a pair of parallel metal strips,
like railroad tracks, running along the center of the passage.
</P>
<P>
"Juran, you know what I think this is? A coal mine!"
</P>
<P>
Juranda snaps her fingers. "You're right! And by the looks of it, it hasn't been
used in a long time."
</P>
<P>
They follow the tunnel around a corner, and came upon a car of some kind,
its four wheels mounted on the track. Most of the car is a large bin, filled
with coal.
</P>
<P>
Next to the car is a strange sight-a wide doorway to a brightly lit room
beyond. The room seems out of place here in the coal mine, especially
its white polished granite walls.
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the center of the strange side room is an even stranger-looking
machine.
</P>
<P>
"Let's take a closer look at that peculiar machine," says Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, let's keep going," says Bivotar.
