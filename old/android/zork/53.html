They enter the brightly lit room with the granite walls and approach
the strange machine. It is shaped vaguely like a washing machine,
with white enamel sides and a large lid on top. The controls consist
of one solitary button. A label on the front of the machine, faded
but still legible, says
</P>
<P>
<CENTER>Frobozz Magic Compressor</CENTER>
</P>
<P>
Some fine print beneath the name is too faded to read.
</P>
<P>
"Try pressing the button," suggests Juranda.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar presses the button. The machine comes to life with a dazzling
display of colored lights and bizarre noises. After a few moments,
the display ends.
</P>
<P>
"Interesting, but not very productive," Bivotar comments.
</P>
<P>
Juranda opens the lid and looks inside the machine. "It's empty," she
says. "Let's try putting something inside, and then turning it on
again."
</P>
<P>
"Like what?" asks Bivotar, looking through his possessions,
</P>
<P>
"How about some coal from out there in the car?" Juranda leaves for a
moment and returns with an armload of coal. She dumps the coal into the
machine and closes the lid.
</P>
<P>
"Here goes," Bivotar says as he pushes the button. The machine reacts
as it did before. When the display of lights and noise has subsided,
Juranda opens the lid.
</P>
<P>
"Look!" she gasps, withdrawing a huge diamond.
</P>
<P>
"Wow!"
</P>
<P>
"But of course! It's a compressor. Remember? Diamonds are just coal that
has undergone tremendous pressure!" She puts the diamond in her pack.
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's get going."
</P>
<P>
"But wait a minute," says Bivotar. "There's a lot of coal out there in that
bin. We could make a whole bunch of these diamonds!"
</P>
<P>
"That isn't what we came here for," protests Juranda.
