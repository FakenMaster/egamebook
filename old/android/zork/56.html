"Well, okay," says Juranda. "I guess it wouldn't hurt to make a few
more diamonds..."

Bivotar dashes out to the car and returns with an armful of coal.
While Juranda operates the compressor, Bivotar goes to get another

Unfortunately, the fine print on the label, which was too faded for
Juranda or Bivotar to read, was a warning message. The warning explained
that using a Frobozz Magic Compressor more than three times in one day
can cause the machine's delicate magic circuits to overload. Sure enough,
in the middle of producing a diamond, the compressor explodes. The
resulting pyrotechnic display removes Bivotar, Juranda, and a good chunk
of the coal mine.
