"We're getting nowhere with this guy," says Bivotar, clenching his
fists.
</P>
<P>
"Forget about that dumb gnome and his dumb toll gate. Let's go this
way." Juranda leads Bivotar into the tunnel littered with bones.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the look of this tunnel," comments Bivotar.
"You can't be scared of a few old bones," Juranda answers.
</P>
<P>
After walking for two minutes, they come to an ornate wooden door.
There is a sign on the door engraved in a flowery script:
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><I>May Eternal Peace Be Yours</I></CENTER>
</P>
<P>
"Sounds intriguing, Juran. Let's go in."
</P>
<P>
They open the door and enter a dimly lit room. The floor is covered with
a plush carpet, and the walls seem to be covered with velvet.
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the Frobozz Magic Crematorium," says the welcoming robot,
shuttling and locking the door behind him. The robot appears to be
rusty and in need of repair. He gives off occasional sparks and puffs
of smoke.
</P>
<P>
"Are these stiffs ready yet, Leo?" says a second robot, floating toward
them. The second robot also seems to be old and damaged.
</P>
<P>
"Stiffs? What are you talking about?" Bivotar demands.
</P>
<P>
"Hey Rocky, I don't remember corpses ever talking before," remarks the
robot called Leo.
</P>
<P>
"Ah, who can remember," Rocky replies. "It's been a hundred and
forty-two years since the last stiff. I'll be lucky if I remember how
to use the equipment.
</P>
<P>
"Hey! Now wait a minute..." Juranda is cut short as the robots grab
her and Bivotar and drug them into the Frobozz Magic Incinerator. Leo
shuts the door as Rocky begins to press the buttons, humming with
contentment.
</P>
<P>
A bit later, Leo opens the door and floats into the chamber.
Nothing remains except a pile of bones. "Hey Rocky! Your turn to take
out the bones!"
</P>
