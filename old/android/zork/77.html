As they enter the dragon's room, the dragon gives a deep-throated
roar, and moves to block the tunnel on the far side of the cavern.
</P>
<P>
"That dragon looks pretty mean," says Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Juran, I have an idea. Let's try casting that spell for talking
to animals. Maybe we can convince him that we're friendly."
</P>
<P>
"Good idea!" Juranda unrolls the spell scroll, looks at the dragon,
and chants, "Utteryak parlo babalon nitfol verbalate."
</P>
<P>
Gradually, the dragon's roar seems to coalesce into understandable
language. "Begone, little creatures," the rumble seems to be saying.
"You cannot pass by Leblong the Dragon."
</P>
<P>
"We mean you no harm, Leblong," Bivotar shouts. "We only wish to
continue on our journey.
</P>
<P>
The dragon gives a bellowing laugh, which shakes the cavern walls and
covers Bivotar with a cloud of ash and smoke. "Not a chance, little one.
I guard this cavern because of an agreement with the great warlock
Grawl. He agreed to dispose of my treacherous twin brother Berlong.
In exchange, I promised to guard this tunnel from trespassers for the next
thousand years."
</P>
<P>
"And there is no way that you would break this oath?" asks Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Only if I saw my despicable twinling Berlong again. Then I would know
that Grawl had failed to honor his part of the bargain, and I would no
longer feel duty-bound to follow my promise."
