"We'll never get past that dragon," says Bivotar. "We'd better turn back."
</P>
<P>
"Not so fast, Biv. I've got an idea." Juranda calls out to the dragon:
"Leblong, did you say that the warlock Grawl vowed to kill your twin
brother Berlong?"
</P>
<P>
"That is true," the dragon rumbles.
</P>
<P>
"That's funny, because we just saw Berlong a little way back."
</P>
<P>
Leblong eyes Juranda warily. "How do you know it was Berlong?"
</P>
<P>
"He told us," answers Bivotar, jumping in. "Besides, he looked
exactly like you."
</P>
<P>
"He said that if we should happen to run into you, we should tell you
he's waiting for you," adds Juranda.
</P>
<P>
The dragon thinks for a moment. "I don't believe you," he announces
finally.
</P>
<P>
"Then come with us, and we'll lead you to him!"
</P>
<P>
Leblong thinks for a long time again. "I will come," he growls, "but I
won't let either of you out of my sight for a moment, and if either of you
should attempt to slip past me, I will burn you in an instant."
</P>
<P>
"Good enough," answers Juranda bravely. "Follow."
</P>
<P>
Juranda and Bivotar preced Leblong, leading the dragon back along the
passage. Presently, they arrive at the cool cavern with the mirror of ice.
</P>
<P>
"There," yells Juranda, pointing at the glacier. "There is Berlong!"
</P>
<P>
Leblong looks at the ice and sure enough-he sees what appears to be his
treacherous twin brother. While dragons are not stupid, they are often
naive, and this dragon has spent most of his life sitting in one room.
He has never seen ice, or a mirror, and so who can blame him when he
mistakes his own reflection for his hated twin brother?
</P>
<P>
Leblong rears back on his powerful hind legs and bellows a fiery challenge.
The reflection responds in kind! The dragon then directs a gout of fire
right at his foe, followed by another, and another. The flame washes
across the ice, which begins to melt. Leblong sees his enemy unharmed,
and redoubles his efforts. Barrages of fire strike the ice. Torrents
of water begin pouring off the glacier, swirling about the room.
</P>
<P>
Juranda and Bivotar are swept off their feet by a wave of water, and are
washed down a tunnel away from the glacier cavern. Waves of icy water
splash all about them. Finally, the waters recede, and they find themselves
in the middle of the room where they first met the dragon. Leblong is
nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
"Wow! Close call, that time," says Juranda, wringing water from her clothes.
</P>
<P>
"Nice thinking, Juran."
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's safe to continue now. Let's get going before Leblong comes back."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar begins picking up their possessions. As he lifts the lamp, he
moans, "Oh no! Just what we need. The lamp looks like it's going out!"
</P>
<P>
Juranda examines it. "It must have gotten damaged by the water."
Even as she speaks, the light from the lamp grows dimmer.

<I>Did you get the scroll with the light spell from the rockworm tribe?
