"Here," says Juranda, reaching into her pack. "Take this diamond, only
let us by!"
</P>
<P>
"Patience, patience," scolds the gnome. He examines the diamond through
his loupe. "It is, once again, a fine gem. However, it is also rather
puny."
</P>
<P>
"Are you going to let us by or not?" shouts Bivotar, losing his temper.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I suppose I will accept these baubles this time. However don't
expect me to accept such a paltry toll the next time you pass this way."
Moving slowly, the gnome unlocks the gate and swings it open.
Bivotar and Juranda pass through, glaring at the greedy gnome, and
continue down the passage.
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the paassage widens into a large cavern. The air in
the cavern is quite chilly.
</P>
<P>
"Look!" gasps Bivotar, pointing. One side of the cavern is a giant
wall of ice, the tip of some subterranean glacier. Its surface is
smooth and shiny, reflecting their lantern light like an enormous
mirror.
</P>
<P>
It's beautiful," Juranda whispers.
</P>
<P>
After admiring the mirror of ice for a few more moments, they cross
the cavern and continue down the passage. The air grows warmer again,
and the walls of the passage here seem scarred and blackened as if
by some tremendous heat.
</P>
<P>
The passage turns a corner and suddenly opens into another wide
cavern. The floor of the cavern is strewn with rocks and boulders. Sitting
in the middle of the cavern is a mighty dragon, smoke curling from his
nostrils!

<I>Did you get the spell for talking to beasts in their own tongue?
