<blockquote>
Remember those old choose-your-own-adventure books you used to have when
you were six years old where you would flip from page to page creating
the story as you went along.  Well, okay, maybe you don't.  But I certainly
do.  It was my first experience with role-playing, and is probably some of
the first hypertext ever created.  I've dug up a real gem of a book that
cried out to me to be transcribed into HTML format.  The original book is
called "Zork, The Cavern Of Doom" and was written by S. Eric Meretzky for
Infocom, the same person and company that created the interactive adventures
that were hugely popular back in the days of forty columns.  The 
book's copyright information follows. Scroll down to begin.</blockquote>

<P>
  You are bored. There's nothing on TV except some stupid reruns. You wander
into your local book store and pick up an interesting-looking book entitled
<I>Zork: The Cavern of Doom.</I> As usual, you turn to the first
page and begin reading.
</P>
<P>
  The book is set in the magical land of Zork, where a new, incredibly rich
underground realm has just been discovered. Dozens of adventurers have
entered The Cavern of Doom, but none have returned. Only YOU can save
them! There are bad-tempered warlocks, huge diamonds, dragons, and a giant
empire to explore.  It looks like this book is good!

<I>Do you choose to save the kingdom?  If so, <A HREF="7.html">read on!</A>
</P>
<P>
Or do you choose to <A HREF="2.html">go home and watch reruns?</A></I>
