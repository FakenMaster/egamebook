"Well, the Hall of Mirros sounds like the safest to me." Bivotar decides.
"Let's go that way."
</P>
<P>
They enter the passageway labeled "The Hall of Mirrors." Toward the
beginning, the passage is low and narrow. However, it soon becomes wider
and wider, and finally ends at a large room.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar and Juranda gasp as they enter the room-it is the banquet hall of
the Castle of Zork! A gigantic mirror fills the far end of the room,
just as they remember.
</P>
<P>
"Juran, how did we get back to the castle?"
</P>
<P>
"Something looks wrong, Biv. Look, that tapestry there belongs on the right
side of the hall, but here it's on the left. And those windows, those
are on the wrong side of the room, also!"
</P>
<P>
"Then this isn't the banquet hall of the castle!"
</P>
<P>
"No it's an exact replica of the hall, only backwards-a mirror image! And
buried here, far underground!"
</P>
<P>
Bivotar approaches the mirror. "Then that image there, on the other side of
the mirror, that's the real banquet hall. If only there was a way to get
there..." He reaches out toward the mirror. As his fingers touch the surface,
there comes a rumble from deep within the earth. The room shakes, and all
three are thrown to the floor.
</P>
<P>
When the floor stops shaking, Bivotar stands and looks around. "Juranda,
we did it! This is the real banquet hall! We're back in the castle!"
</P>
<P>
Juranda looks around also. "Biv! Where's Grum? And who...who is that?"
</P>
<P>
Where Gurm had been before the earthquake, there now stands a handsome young
man dressed in princely robes. Only his eyes seem familiar, filled with
warmth and compassion. "I am Logrumethar," he states. "The enchantment
is broken!"
</P>
<P>
They hear a cry from across the hall as Syovar enters. "Juranda! Bivotar!
I felt that rumble and came to investigate. I have been so worried..."
Syovar suddenly notices the figure in the princely garb. He freezes in his
tracks, speechless. Then he runs to Logrumethar and embraces him. "My
son, my son," he cries, tears streaming from his eyes. "I thought I should
never see you again!"
</P>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<P>
That evening, Syovar holds a mighty banquet to celebrate the return of
Logrumethar. Noblemen and enchanters from every township in the kingdom
are present. Syovar and his son sit at the head table, flanked by Bivotar
and Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand exactly what happened," says Bivotar, between mouthfuls.
"How was the enchantment broken?"
</P>
<P>
Syovar smiles broadly. "There are some things that even a warlock of Grawl's
might cannot foresee."
</P>
<P>
"My father was right to send you into the Cavern of Doom. He, and he alone,
felt that you would succeed where so many brave adventurers and mighty
warriors had failed."
</P>
<P>
"In fact," continues Syovar, "the enchantment began to break when you
demonstrated your feelings from Grum as a person were more important than
your feelings about his appearance."
</P>
<P>
"But it wasn't until you touched the mirror," Logrumethar adds, "and
transported us back here, that the last of the curse was destroyed.
Only then were my memories and appearance restored, and 'Grum' put to
rest forever."
</P>
<P>
"And now, says Syovar, standing, "it is my turn to test my abilities."
An expectant hush falls over the banquet hall. Syovar begins casting a
spell so powerful that the very air in the room seems to crackle with
energy. A cloud of smoke forms in the center of the hall. The cloud
begins spinning around, swirling madly like a tiny tornado. It grows
larger...and larger...and then suddenly it is gone!
</P>
<P>
In its place, standing in the center of the huge hall, looking dazed and
confused, are a hundred or more explorers, treasure hunters, and
knights. With one fantastic effort, Syovar has returned all the stone
figures to life, and transported them back to the castle.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Bivotar and Juranda are buried under a mass of elvish hugs.
</P>
<P>
"Max!" shouts Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Fred!" Bivotar yells.
</P>
<P>
"Max and Fred went exploring new underground realm," explains Max. "Many
dangers."
</P>
<P>
"Fred found this jade figurine," says Fred, holding it up.
</P>
<P>
"Wait a minute! Max found figurine." Max tries to snatch the figurine away
from Fred.
</P>
<P>
"Did not! Fred saw it first!"
</P>
<P>
Syovar roars with laughter. "Calm down, you two, you'll destroy the entire
castle if you keep fighting." He touches the jade figurine and immediately
each elf is holding an identical figurine.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Fred did find it first," admits Max.
</P>
<P>
"But Max was maybe first to pick it up," Fred points out.
</P>
<P>
Syovar turns to Bivotar and Juranda. "Unfortunately, the time has come for
us to say goodbye once again. I am now thrice indebted to you, but this
time you have done a deed I value even more than my own life, returning
to me my beloved son. I can never repay you, but return again and I shall
certainly try." He hugs both of them warmly. "And don't forget the ring,"
he says, handing Juranda the Ring of Zork.
</P>
<P>
The world goes dark for a moment, and then Bill and June are sitting on
the ledge atop Lookout Point. The sun is beginning to sink low in the
western sky. June looks at bill, and slips the ring into her pocket.
No words are necessary to share their feelings as they mount their
bicycles for the ride home, for they know that they will soon visit the
magical Kingdom of Zork again.
