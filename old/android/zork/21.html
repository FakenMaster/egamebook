Syovar seems pleased by their decision, and leads them to his private
study, a cozy room filled with books and ancient curios. A fire roars
in the hearth.
</P>
<P>
As they munch on delicious cakes and sip a strange herbal tea, Syovar
reminisces about his childhood days during the height of the Great
Underground Empire. He recalls how he learned magic from an aged
sorcerer named Hermacedus. Bivotar and Juranda are surprised to learn
that Syovar was married once, during the last days before the fall of
the Empire. His wife, Lorena, was killed by an enemy of Syovar, an evil
warlock named Grawl. Grawl also cast a powerful spell on Syovar's only
son, Logrumethar, and exiled him to a distand land. Syovar was never
able to locate his son again, and has finally forced himself to admit
that Logrumethar is dead.
</P>
<P>
As the fire grows dimmer, Syovar tells them of the rise and fall of the
Great Underground Empire-a mighty kingdom carved right into the bedrock
of the earth, a kindgom of wondrous sights, tremendous wealth, and
powerful magic. But, because of the decadence of its ruler, Lord Dimwit
Flathead, the empire finally fell.
</P>
<P>
Following the fall, evil times came to the Land of Frobozz, as every
warlock in the kindom attempted to gain control. Finally, Syovar helped
recreate the Knights of Zork, an ancient royal army, to help bring order
to the land. With the defeat of Krill, the most powerful of the warlocks,
peace returned.
</P>
<P>
Now the Great Underground Empire is rising once more. Each week, new
areas of the old underground caverns are rediscovered, explored, and
settled. Flood Control Dam Number Three is once again the famous
tourist spot it was at the height of the empire, and the Mines of Zork
are once again producing coal and diamonds. Syovar speaks softly of his
dream of uniting all the neighboring lands into a peaceful, happy kindom.
</P>
<P>
A troubled look comes over Syobar's face. "Recently," Syovar says,
"explorers have discovered a new section of the Great Underground Empire,
and adventurers and treasure hunters have flocked into the vast new area.
None have returned.
</P>
<P>
"Several knights have gone in to search for the missing explorers, but they
have not returned either. With utmost reluctance, I have been forced to
seal up that section of the Underground Empire forever, to prevent more
disappearances." Syobar pauses, and looks sadly towards Bivotar and
Juranda. "Unfortunately, Max and Fred, the two elves who joined your
quest to resque me from the wizard Malifestro, are among the missing."
</P>
<P>
Syovar absentmindedly strokes his beard. "I attempted to use my magical
powers to explore this Cavern of Doom, but they were unable to penetrate
it. It is as though the entire region were guarded by some powerful
enchantment. All I could glean was a vague feeling that only someone
completely innocent, only someone pure of heart, could enter that enchanted
cavern and return."
</P>
<P>
Syovar pauses, lost in thought. The room has grown dark; the fire has
turned into a bed of glowing embers. Syovar shakes himself out of his
reverie. "Well, look how late it is! You two had best be off to your
chambers." He summons a servant to escort them.
</P>
<P>
Later that night, Juranda quietly enters Bivotar's chamber. She wakes
him gently. "Hey, Biv..."
</P>
<P>
"Hurglumph? Oh, it's you. What's up?"
</P>
<P>
"We've got to go to the Cavern of Doom."
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Bivotar says, rolling over. "First thing in the morning."
</P>
<P>
"I'm serious," insists Juranda.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar stares at her. "You must be wacko! You heard what Syovar said-no
one has ever gone in there and returned!"
</P>
<P>
"But he also said that someone who was young and innocent could enter
and return. We probably fit that bill as much as anyone around." Before
Bivotar can object, Juranda hurriedly continues. "And we've got to find
Max and Fred-they're our friends!"
