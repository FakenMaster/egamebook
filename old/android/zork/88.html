"Doesn't look like that dragon will let us pass, Biv."
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but I bet we can sneak by him. He doesn't seem that bright."
</P>
<P>
"Do you have a plan?"
</P>
<P>
"Yup. First we convince the dragon that we've left. Then we'll
sneak around the edge of the cavern, behind all those boulders."
</P>
<P>
"Sounds good to me," agrees Juranda.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar raises his voice. "Well, we'd better be going. Farewell, Leblong!"
</P>
<P>
"Farewell, flameless ones," Leblong rumbles.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar leads Juranda toward the mouth of the tunnel they recently left.
Just before they reach it, they duck behind one of the large boulders.
</P>
<P>
"Okay," Bivotar whispers. "I think we fooled him. Follow me."
</P>
<P>
They begin winding around the perimeter of the cavern, darting from
behind one boulder to the next.
</P>
<P>
"Almost there," says Bivotar in a hushed voice. "Just one more gap to cross."
</P>
<P>
They scurry toward the cover of the final boulder. The mouth of the other
passage looms ahead. Just before they reach the last boulder, Bivotar
trips on a small rock and goes sprawling. Juranda rushes to help him to
his feet. The dragon, hearing the noise, turns toward them.
</P>
<P>
"No one sneaks past Leblng!" roars the dragon. He raises up to his full
height (about thirty feet), stares down at them, and then burns them to
cinders with a blast of flaming breath.
