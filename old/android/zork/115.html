"Okay, let's go this way," says Juranda, entering the dorway labeled
"The Crypt of Death."
</P>
<P>
"Uh, doesn't that sound a little dangerous?" asks Bivotar, hesitating.
</P>
<P>
"Don't be such a yellow-belly, Biv."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar grumbles, but follows Juranda and Grum through the doorway. They
enter a low tunnel, which ends a short while later at the entrance to a
stone crypt. The entrance to the crypt is open, beckoning them to enter.
Surrounding the entrance are numerous skulls, perched on poles. The
skills almost seem to be grinning at them.
</P>
<P>
They enter the crypt warily. An inscription on the wall reads:

Twelve stone coffins line the walls of the crypt.
</P>
<P>
With a reverberating slam, the enormous stone door shuts behind them.
Several months, or years, later, a caretaker wanders through and adds
their skulls to the collection outside the door.
