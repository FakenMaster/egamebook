<P>
A bolt of lightning crashes across the sky, and explodes to the ground at
your feet. There is a puff of smoke, and the Prince of Kaldorn appears
before you. Startled, you drop the book you are reading.
</P>
<P>
The Prince bends down and picks it up. He reads the cover of the book.
"Hmmm...let's see. <I>The Cavern of Doom</I>." He produces a notebook
and begins making an entry.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Prince of Kaldorn was living in exile and working
as a shoe peddler. Recently, though, he has been appointed Assistant
Third Class, in the Anti-Cheating Bureau of Zorkbooks, Inc., whose job
it is to prevent exactly the sort of brazen fraudulence you have just
displayed.
</P>
<P>
The prince finishes his notation. "I have taken down the name and serial
number of this book," the Prince explains. "Since there are no light spells
or rockworm tribes in this book, it is clear that you were cheating.
If you repeat this offense, you will be turned into a newt." He wags his
finger at you, and then vanishes.
</P>

<P>
<I>Your score is so low that mathematicians have not yet invented a number
to describe it.
</P>
<P>
Normally, I'd recommend giving you another chance, but not in this case,
cheater!</I>
