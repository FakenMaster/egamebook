<P>
"How?"

"Look at all these rocks on the ground," says Juranda pointing.
"We'll each take a few, climb up on those boulders over there,
and pummel him with the rocks. We'll aim for the head."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar looks skeptical, but joins Juranda in gathering up several
large stones. When they are in position, Juranda gives the signal,
and they hurl the rocks toward Leblong's head.

Unfortunately, dragon hide is very tough, and the rocks bounce
harmlessly off. However, they do seem to enrage Leblong, who roars
indignantly, draws back, and expels a terrific blast of fire toward
them. Bivotar and Juranda are reduced to ashes.
