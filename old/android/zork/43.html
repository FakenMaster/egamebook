Juranda and Bivotar continue to crawl along the small tunnel with the slimy
floor and the strange rock formations. The air is warm and moist.

<P>
Suddenly the floor begins vibrating strangely, and the walls of the tunnel begin
contracting around them.
</P>
<P>
"What's going on?" shouts Juranda, confused.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, but let's get out of here," yells Bivotar, crawling back toward
the fork. "The amulet has started to glow!"
</P>
<P>
"Omigosh! Biv, we're not in a tunnel! And those aren't stalactites-they're
teeth!"
</P>
<P>
"Burp!" says the cave behemoth, a short time later.
