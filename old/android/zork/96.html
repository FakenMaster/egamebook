"Okay, you're right," concedes Juranda. "Let's continue. But we'd better
hurry."
</P>
<P>
They enter the tunnel that was previously guarded by Leblong the dragon.
It is straight and level, and they travel quickly. The lantern grows
even dimmer. Finally, after about five minutes, the lamp goes out
completely, leaving Bivotar and Juranda surrounded by darkness. They hear
a gurgling noise close by, accompanies by what could be the sound of
gnashing teeth.
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Juranda notices a spot of light in the distance ahead of
them. She grabs Bivotar and points it out. "Come on," she cries, "let's
make a run for it!"
</P>
<P>
From behind them comes a cry of anger as the lurking creature sense its
prey escaping. There are sounds of pursuit. Bivotar and Juranda run even
faster toward the growing circle of light. Juranda stumbles over something
in the dark and drops her pack, but regains her balance. With a final
burst of speed, they fly out of the dark tunnel and into a lighted area.
From behind them comes a cry of pain and fear, and they turn just in time
to see a creature with enormous fangs turn and dash back into the darkness.
</P>
<P>
"Whew," exlaims Bivotar, his chest heaving. "Another close call."
</P>
<P>
"I dropped all the food while running," says Juranda. "I'm sorry."
</P>
<P>
"And I dropped the lamp, although I guess it's not much good any more
anyway. But at least you managed to hang onto the talisman." Juranda
glances down at the magic amulet, which is dark.
</P>
<P>
They turn to survey their new locale, and are greeted by an amazing
sight: an enormous cavern, easily a mile across, filled with rock
formations of every imaginable shape. The ceiling, far above, is covered
with layer upon layer of phosphorescent mosses, glowing with every color
of the rainbow. The floor of the cavern is covered with literally
hundreds of stone statues, life-sized figures of knights, explorers,
adventurers, and elves. The closest of these statues is only a few feet
away.
</P>
<P>
"These statues are amazing, Biv. They're so life-like."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar examines one of the statues more closely. "Juran...these aren't
statues." His voice fills with fear. "They're people...people turned to
stone!"
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a voice calls out to them. It is a hoarse croak, inhuman and
horrible to hear. "Go away! Leave Grum alone. Please come in not
here. Sorry will you be, yes." The owner of the voice is hidden from
view among the statues. There is another exit just to their left.
