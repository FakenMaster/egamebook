Bivotar and Juranda enter the stone hut. The entire first floor seems to be
one large room, with a small wooden table and some chairs. They sit at
the table and eat a hurried lunch from the provisions that Syovar gave them.
</P>
<P>
"Let's have a look around," suggests Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
A brief inspection of the room reveals nothing of interest. However, a stone
staircase spirals downward, indicating a cellar below. Warily, they descend
the stairs, and find themselves in a musty chamber filled with cobwebs.
Wooden tables line the room, covered with many curious items:  scrolls
of parchment, a stuffed owl, a rack of wands, and bottles of liquid and
powder.
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Juranda notices the talisman that Syovar gave them. "Biv, look at
the amulet. It's beginning to glow. Syovar told us that meant there was evil
nearby."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar examines the talisman. "It's only glowing very faintly. Syovar also
said that if evil was close by, it would glow very brightly."
</P>
<P>
"Look at this," Juranda calls, pointing to a sign on the wall.
</P>

"Didn't Syovar mention that Grawl was a powerful and evil warlock?"
asks Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think so. Hey, look at this!" Bivotar picks up one of the parchment
scrolls. "It's a spell for speaking with beasts in their own tongue. That
sounds as if it might be fun." He puts the scroll in his pack.
</P>
<P>
"Biv!" Juranda cries. "Tha amulet is glowing brighter! We'd better get out
of here."
</P>
<P>
"But there are still a lot of interesting things here," Bivotar protests.
