"Okay," grumbles Bivotar, removing the giant ruby from his pack.

just climb over your dumb gate and keep going?"
</P>

"That would be most annoying," responds the gnome, smiling even more
broadly. "In that case, I would be forced to summon my colleague, Tholl.
He's a rather large troll. Tholl the Toll Troll, they call him. And
while he's not very bright, he is quite vicious. Now, about that
