"I'd really like to see the crafts fair," says Juranda.

"They usually bore me to tears," sighs Syovar, "but if you insist..."

He takes them into the tremendous courtyard of the castle. Rows of
booths line the walls, and the aisles are jammed with people. The odor of
steaming figs wafts through the air. Monkeys, wearing brightly colored
jackets, perform juggling acts and acrobatic tricks. A band of lute
players adds to the festive atmosphere.

<P>
The booths display a stunning variety of items. Some dwarves from a kingdom
far to the south display finely woven silk fabrics of every imaginable
color. At the next booth are intricate straw baskets and chairs. The next
table displays an amazing collection of tiny, beautifully hand-painted
pottery bowls, designed to hold magic powders and ointments. Each booth
is more intriguing than the last, and they wander down the aisles until
twilight signals an end to the crafts fair.

Syovar leads them to the sumptuous guest rooms of the castle, where Bivotar
and Juranda quickly fall into a deep sleep. The next morning, Bivotar
pulls Juranda aside.

"I think that maybe we hurt Syovar's feelings yesterday by not letting him
tell us his stories."
</P>
<P>
"Now that you mention it, Biv, he did look a little hurt when we told him
we wanted to go to the crafts fair.  But maybe he'll agree to do it today
instead."
</P>
<P>
"It's worth asking. I'd certainly like to hear him."
