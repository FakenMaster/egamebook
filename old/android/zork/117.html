"How about this door?" asks Bivotar, walking toward the exit labeled
"The Dungeon of Dry Bones."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I like the sound of that signpost," says Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Oh, come on, if it looks dangerous, we'll come back and try another
direction."
</P>
<P>
Juranda looks skeptical, but follows Bivotar and Grum through the doorway.
They enter a long passage with roughly hewn walls. After walking for about
ten minutes, Bivotar spots a shaft of light crossing the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
"What do you think about this light, Juran?"
</P>
<P>
"Beats me. I can't tell where it's coming from."
</P>
<P>
"Oh, well. Let's go on. There's still no end to this tunnel in sight."
</P>
<P>
They walk forward, and as soon as they cross the beam of light, the floor
beneath them opens up! They fall into a long, smooth, sloping shaft.
Down and down they slide, for what seems like an eternity. Finally, they
land with a painful thud on a damp floor strewn with straw and human
bones. After a long period, their bones join the others in the dungeon.
