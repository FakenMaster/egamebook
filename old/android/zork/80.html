As Bivotar and Juranda enter the dragon's lair, the dragon
gives a deep growl and a plume of hot steam pours from its nostrils.
It waves its head towards them, growls again, and then lets loose a
mighty roar. A hot cloud of smoke washes across the two adventurers.
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't seem too friendly," comments Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"It's almost as though he was trying to tell us something," Juranda
notes.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I don't know dragonese, or whatever it is that dragons
speak."
</P>
<P>
"Well, let's not mess with it. Let's just go around the edge of this
cavern and continue on down the passage."
</P>
<P>
"Fine by me," agrees Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
As they attempt to pass by the dragon, it bellows a deep-throated roar,
rears its head back, and spews a gigantic plume of flame straight at
Bivotar and Juranda. They are instantly fried to a crisp.
