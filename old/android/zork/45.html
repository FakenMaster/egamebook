Juranda paces nervously as Bivotar continues to search through Grawl's
curios and potions.

"Look at this, Juran!" Bivotar takes a pinch of black powder from a jar and
tosses it toward the ground. A giant puff of blue smoke appears. The smoke
clears, revealing a tiny newt, which scurries off into the shadows. "Not bad,
huh?"

Suddenly, they hear from upstairs the sound of the hut's door closing. The
amulet glows strongly. There is a loud cry of anger, and then a small
shriveled man comes flying down the staircase. "Thieves! Vandals!" he
cries, in a voice that is considerably more menacing than his appearance.
He extends a crooked hand toward Juranda and Bivotar. A bolt of light
leaps toward them, and suddenly the newt has company in the shadows.
