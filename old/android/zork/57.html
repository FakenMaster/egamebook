Bivotar and Juranda continue to traverse the coal mine. After a while,
the tracks disappear, and the walls become gray and rocky again.
</P>
<P>
The air grows moist, and at various points trickles of water
run down the walls of the tunnel. Dark green mosses grow abundantly
where these trickles appear. Just beyond a particularly thick
growth of mosses, they come to a small tunnel leading off from the main
one.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar shines the lantern into the small side tunnel. It is very short,
forming a dead end forty or fifty feet away. Sitting on the ground, just
before the end wall, is a wooden trunk, bulging with jewels!
</P>
<P>
On the floor of the side passage, between the trunk and the two
adventurers, is a carpet of green plants. They sway slowl from side
to side, which is rather odd since there is almost no breeze in the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
"Juran! Look at that trunk of jewels! Let's take a closer look."
</P>
<P>
"Wait," cautions Juranda. "Those plant things might not be as harmless
as they look."
