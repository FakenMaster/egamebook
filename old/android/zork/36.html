After a brief argument, Bivotar and Juranda agree to take the smoother
passage.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, which is fairly tight to begin with, grows increasingly
smaller as they move further along. In addition, interesting rows of
stalagmites and stalactites begin appearing. Unlike normal rocky formations
in caverns, these appear only at the left and right sides of the tunnel.
Also, they are strange in both texture and color, smooth and pearly
white. Finally unlike normal stalctites and stalagmites, they are
slightly curved.

"Doesn't the ground feel unusually soft?" asks Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"Yes. And sort of slimy, too," Juranda adds.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we ought to go back to the fork and try that other passage."
