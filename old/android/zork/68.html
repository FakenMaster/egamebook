"We won't be able to pay the toll, Biv."

"Yeah, well, nuts to that fat old gnome, anyway. Let's go this way
instead." He heads off toward the dark hole.
</P>
<P>
Juranda looks down into the hole. "It's pretty dark down there, and
if we have to climb down on this rope we won't be able to carry
anything."
</P>
<P>
"I don't care, as long as I never see that grinning gnome again."
Bivotar drops the lantern and his pack and begins climbing down the rope.
Juranda puts her own possessions down, and follows.
</P>
<P>
The rope ends a few feet above the ground. The only thing they can see
is a faint circle of light above them-the hole they just climbed down-
and the faintly glowing amulet. From the darkness around them comes
loud, gurgling sounds.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Bivotar and Juranda have dropped right into a well-populated
grue lair. Grues are vicious carnivorous beasts that occupy every dark
corner of the Great Underground Empire. Their favorite diet is adventurers,
and their only fear is that of light.
</P>
<P>
Their fangs are long, sharp, and numerous, which they waste no time in
demonstrating to our hapless heroes.
