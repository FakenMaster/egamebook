Bivotar and Juranda enter the new passage. After a short distance, it
ends at a narrow stairway leading upward, lined with flickering torches.
They climb the stairs, which are hundreds of steps tall. Finally the
stairs end, and they enter a small torchlit room filled with countless
treasures, many dusty sacks, and a scattering of bones. It is apparently
the secret hideout of an underground robber.

<P>
There is a scream of anguish in the air. Armed with a silver stiletto,
glinting in the torchlight, a lean man suddenly appears in the doorway
and eyes them warily.

<P>
The magic amulet glows brightly.
</P>
<P>
He notices the amulet, and speaking with a coarse voice in some ancient
and forgotten language, makes it clear that he wants to add the amulet
to his collection of treasures. When Bivotar and Juranda do not respond,
he lashes out with his stiletto. Being unarmed, Bivotar and Juranda find
the battle a trifle one-sided.
