"We'd better listen to him, Juran."
"I'm not so sure," says Juranda. "These statues, all these people-
these must be the explorers who have entered the Cavern of Doom but
never returned! They're all right here!"
</P>
<P>
"Then let's get out of here before we turn to stone, also!"
</P>
<P>
"Biv, the amulet isn't glowing. So there's no evil here."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar thinks for a minute, then nods. "Okay. Let's go meet our
unseen companion."
</P>
<P>
They take a few more steps into the cavern, toward the hidden creature.
They are now surrounded on all sides by the stone figures. Suddenly, the
voice cries out again.
</P>
<P>
"Please, come not any closer! You, too, turned into stone will be!"
</P>
<P>
They pause, and catch a glimpse of a figure darting behind a group of
statues, as though hiding. Bivotar calls out, "Who are you?"
</P>
<P>
"Called Grum am I. Live here I do."
</P>
<P>
"Grum, how did all these people turn ot stone?" Juranda asks.
</P>
<P>
"The work of a terrible warlock it is. His name cannot I even
remember. A powerful enchantment he cast on Grum. He make Grum hideous
and horrible and ugly. Now, anyone who looks at Grum, turned to stone
are they."
</P>
<P>
"Why did the warlock do this to you?" inquires Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"Do not I even know. For long time, Grum here in this room has lived.
No friends have I, no one can I ever talk to."
</P>
<P>
"Oh, Biv! He must be so lonely." Juranda calls to Grum, "Why do you
stay here? Is it part of the spell?"
</P>
<P>
"No, not part of spell. I stay here so that no one can see Grum's ugliness.
Turn others to stone I do not want to do. When those people started coming
here, so happy was I. Coming to see Grum they were, I thought. But as soon
as they saw me, statues did they become. Now quickly go you should, or see
me you may and turn to statues like others." Despite the unnatural timbre
of the voice, it is filled with sadness and compassion.
</P>
<P>
"How can we help him, Biv? We've got to find a way to break the enchantment."
</P>
<P>
A rasping sound can be heard from Grum's direction.
</P>
<P>
"He's...he's crying," says Juranda, sniffling a bit herself.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if he's the ugliest thing in the universe," Bivotar announces.
"He's lonely and he's in pain. I'm going to go meet him."
</P>
<P>
"Biv!" cries Juranda, but he is already running toward Grum. Grum sees
him approaching, and tries to run away but falls to the ground. "No, come
not closer," he wails, trying to hide his face.
</P>
<P>
Bivotar passes the last few statues and arrives at Grum's side. He is indeed
ugly beyond belief, scaly and deformed. But Bivotar ignores the ugliness,
looking only at Grum's wide, compassionate eyes. Slowly, Grum lowers
his arms, trembling with disbelief.
</P>
<P>
"You...you do not turn to statue..."
</P>
<P>
Juranda arrives and kneels next to Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"You're not so horrible," Juranda tells Grum.
</P>
<P>
"She's right, Grum. There are other kinds of beauty beside outside
appearance. There's beauty of the soal. And by trying to warn us not to
come here, and by living alone here for so long rather than risk harming
others, you have demonstrated your inner beauty."
</P>
<P>
Tears stream down Grum's face. "Never imagined did I that anyone would ever
call me beautiful."
</P>
<P>
"Grum, return with us to the world above," suggests Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"No!" Grum cries. "Too dangerous that would be!"
</P>
<P>
"But we have shown you that everyone who sees you doesn't turn to stone,"
argues Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"And we know a very good wizard who might be able to break your enchantment,"
adds Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"Well, perhaps," Grum agrees, "but if just one more person becomes a statue,
right back here will Grum go."
</P>
<P>
"Fair enough," Bivotar says. "But the next problem is how to get back out.
We lost our lantern," he explains to Grum, "and we can't navigate these
underground passages without light."
</P>
<P>
"Very nearby a place is where a torch we can get."
</P>
<P>
"Great! Lead us there."
</P>
<P>
Grum leads them among the statues, toward an opening at the far end of the
cavern. Suddenly, Juranda cries out. "Biv, look!"
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" asks Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
Juranda points at two small stone figures, poised in the middle of an
argument. "It's Max and Fred!"
</P>
<P>
Bivotar stares in horror. "Oh, those poor elves!"
</P>
<P>
"Remember them I do," says Grum. Among first to arrive were they. They
must have just found a jade figurine. Thought they were playing did I,
but they were merely fighting over figurine. Wanted to play also, did I,
but before I could, spotted me had they, and turned to stone as now you
see them."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar and Juranda are silent for a moment, thinking about Max and Fred.
Finally, they turn away, and follow Grum.
</P>
<P>
The opening at the far end of the cavern leads to a short hallway, which
ends at a round room with a domed ceiling. Sitting in the center of the
room, atop a pedestal, is a flaming ivory torch. Four doorways lead from
the room, each one labeled with a signpost. The signpost
for the doorway they just left is labeled.
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><B><I>The Cavern of the Rainbow Mosses</I></B></CENTER>
</P>
<P>
The other three signposts read:
</P>
<P>
<CENTER><I>The Crypt of Death</I>
</P>
<P>
The Dungeon of Dry Bones
</P>
<P>
<B>The Hall of Mirrors</B></CENTER>
</P>
<P>
Juranda takes the ivory torch. "Now that we've got light again, we can go
back the way we came."
</P>
<P>
"Just a second," says Bivotar. "What if we run into Grawl or Leblong again?
Maybe we should take one of these other doorways instead." Bivotar thinks
for a moment. "Well, this is Grum's territory. Grum, do you have any idea
which exit to take?"
</P>
<P>
"Nothing about it does Grum know. Never beyond this point has Grum ever
been."
