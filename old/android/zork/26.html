Bivotar eventually agrees with Juranda, and the next morning at breakfast
he broaches the subject to Syovar.
</P>
<P>
"Um, Syovar," Bivotar begins, "Juranda and I were talking last night and,
uh, and we, uh..."
</P>
<P>
"Yes?" asks Syovar, cracking open a dragon's egg.
</P>
<P>
"We want to go into the Cavern of Doom and rescue Max and Fred," Juranda
blurts out.
</P>
<P>
Syobar looks flabbergasted. "Completely out of the question! It's far
too dangerous!"
</P>
<P>
"But we can't just leave Max and Fred and all those others in there to
dies!" Bivotar protests.
</P>
<P>
"And you said yourself that someone pure of heart could enter the cavern
and return," adds Juranda.
</P>
<P>
Syovar is silent for a time. The agony of indecision shows on his face.
Finally, he nods slowly. "You two are both wise and brave. I cannot
argue with your reasoning. However, remember that over fifty men,
many of them also wise and brave, have gone into that region and have
never returned. Remember also that my powers cannot protect you there.
Do you still wish to go?"
</P>
<P>
Bivotar and Juranda both nod solemnly.
</P>
<P>
"Very well. We will leave at once." Syovar reaches into his tunic and
consults a parchment map. He mumbles a few spells under his breath, and
motions with his arm. In a flash, they are all standing in a small
underground hollow. Bivotar and Juranda are holding stout staffs. A tunnel
slopes upward in one direction. In the other direction is a stone door.
An inscription on the door reads:
</P>
<P><CENTER><H4>
AS RULER OF ALL THE KINDOM OF ZORK<BR>
I HEREBY DECREE THAT THIS<BR>
CAVERN OF DOOM<BR>
HAS BEEN SEALED OFF.<BR>
NO MAN MAY REMOVE THE SPELL THAT PROTECTS THIS DOOR.<BR>
NO MAN MAY PASS THROUGH INTO THE CAVERN BEYOND.<BR>
SYOVAR
</H4></CENTER>
</P>
<P>
Syovar cants a long spell. At first, nothing happens. Then, slowly, the
door swings open. A cold wind swirls through the hollow where they stand.
</P>
<P>
"The cavern may now be entered," says Syovar. He hands them several
bundles. "Here are several days' rations of food and water, and a lamp
to light your way. And this is a powerful talisman." He hands Bivotar
a beautiful amulet, carved from amber, suspended from an intricate
golden chain. "It will glow in the presence of evil. The brighter the
glow, the closer the evil."
</P>
<P>
Syovar places a hand on each of their heads and incants another spell.
Then he says, "I have placed my strongest protection spell on you, but
I cannot say whether it will work...in there. Remember that once you have
entered, I will have to seal this entrance again. You will now be
totally alone."
</P>
<P>
"We understand," says Bivotar.
</P>
<P>
"Then farewell, and may the forces of good watch over you."
</P>
<P>
Bivotar and Juranda pass through the stone doorway. They glance back just
in time to see the door close behind them.
</P>
<P>
Ahead, the tunnel forks. The laft-hand passage seems to get a lot of
use, because its dusty floor is covered with footprints. The other
passage has a smoother, unmarked floor.
