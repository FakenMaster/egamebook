This here is not a textblock, but it's the synopsis. It doesn't live in any of the pages.

Same here!

start

You are in a room full of spiders. The spiders look annoyed.


---     
squash
[[ visitOnce]]

You try to squash the spiders, but there's too many of them. Oh god,
they're eating your face off now!

this is _not_ a next page

---- neither is this


 ---
run
 [[ visitOnce, showOnce ]]  

You managed to get out of the room before the spiders got to you, but now you're in a room full of giant worms.
