You are in a room full of spiders. The spiders look annoyed.

  <import "this should not be picked up">

squash
[[ visitOnce]]

You try to squash the spiders, but there's too many of them. Oh god,
they're eating your face off now!

<import "this is malformed, unmatching quotes'>

run
 [[ visitOnce, showOnce ]]  

You managed to get out of the room before the spiders got to you, but now you're in a room full of giant worms.
