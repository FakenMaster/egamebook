Clinic: Before visit

## Day 1: The End

Maybe there just isn't such a thing as a happy gynaecologist.

You are studying the repair bill on the computer screen, realizing it is almost double of what you have earned so far this month. The clinic hasn't been very busy lately. Fewer and fewer people have the money to pay for a *dentist*, let alone a private gynaecologist. You had to sell your car recently – not that you had the cash for gas, anyway. There's never any cash for anything anymore. This month, there might not be any cash for paying Lydia, even.

Lydia is the lady that brought you up. She has been a nurse in the clinic for ages, originally working with your father, and after he died, with you. You owe her for all that you know about the business side of things, and much more. Still, she has been working practically for free recently.

"Things are falling apart," Lydia told you yesterday. You thought she's talking figuratively, but then she pointed to the cabinet. It was leaning towards a side, one of the legs broken, the paint blistered, top drawer stuck open. She reminded you about the state of the toilet, too, and used the word "disgusting" twice. Other things were falling apart in the waiting room and in your office. That day, you called the cheapest repair service in town. They arrived in under an hour, eyes wide open, smiling, and they quickly took care of everything. Now here's their bill.

Just a couple of years ago, that bill would be worth a portion of your hourly fee. That was when people had the money to pay for things like labiaplasties and 3D ultrasounds. Now, you only see a couple of patients a day, and they are all as broke as you are.

Today, though, is an all-time low. Just one appointment. At least it's a new patient. A young lady called Maria Pruitt.

"A new patient is a good sign," Lydia says when she reminds you about the appointment in the morning. "We haven't had a _new_ patient in, let me see, six months? This could be a turning point. I hope it's a turning point. A new beginning."

What it really is, though, is the beginning of the end. And a spectacular end at that.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

What about the repair bill?
- Pay it [Pay the bill]
- Ignore it [Don't pay the bill]

Clinic: Pay the bill

You slowly scroll down the screen and place your cursor over the button that will take away a large portion of your financial reserve. You inspect the room, checking all the places where the handymen did their work. Everything looks repaired and clean.

You click.

Clinic: Maria is introduced

“Doctor?” Lydia has just opened the door to the office. She knows you from when you were 3 or so, but during office hours you two keep the doctor-nurse roleplay alive. “Maria Pruitt has come 15 minutes early. Can she come in?”

“Maria Pruitt?” you ask. You don’t recall that name.

“The new patient, doctor.”

"Oh!"

- “Please let the patient in.” [introducingMaria]
- “Just a few more minutes, please.” [letHerWait]

---
Clinic: letHerWait

“Just a few more minutes, please,” you blurt out. Lydia nods and closes the door. You remember to look for files or receipts from other patients that may be left lying on the table. That would be unprofessional and might scare away the new business. How can they trust you to keep their records safe if they can see the records of others? But there is nothing of note on the table, and you have nothing else to do than wait. (Well, there are administrative tasks to be taken care of, but none of them could be even started under 15 minutes.)

TODO: mozna muze neco najit, neceho si vsimnout?

After a while, you call Lydia on the intercom.

- “Please let the patient in.” [introducingMaria]

---
Clinic: introducingMaria

“Please let the patient in.”

TODO: slower, better

Maria Pruitt is gorgeous. Also, she says: “I’m here for a preventive examination.”

There is nothing wrong with her.

...

“Your reproductive organs are in perfect shape,” you tell her when she’s putting her pants back on. “Congratulations.” Maria gives you a smile and a nod. “Thanks, doctor.” She’s blushing a little.

“I’m afraid you don’t really need to came back here for a year or so.” You start putting your instruments in the "For Desinfection" tray and acting as if that's it. Because it is. The examination is over.

“O-kay,” she says, takes the patient card and starts to leave.

- Try to stop her [Clinic: stopMaria]
- Say good bye and let her leave [Clinic: letMariaLeave]

Clinic: stopMaria

"Stop!" you blurt out just before Maria reaches for the door knob. She freezes, then slowly turns her head towards you, eyebrows raised.

- "Sorry. Never mind. Good bye." [Clinic: stopMariaGoodbye]
- "Do you think maybe we could meet some other time and other place?" [Clinic: stopMariaDate]

---
Clinic: stopMariaGoodbye

"Sorry. Never mind. Good bye," you say, and feel like a 13 year old boy.

"Good bye," she replies cheerfully, leaves the office and closes the door behind her.

- [Clinic: endMariaEncounter]

---
Clinic: stopMariaDate

<script>
  askedMariaForADate = true;
</script>

"Do you think maybe we could meet some other time and other place? I mean, other than a clinic?" You try to smile confidently, but it turns out as awkward as that sentence. Maria lets go of the knob and studies you for a while. You can already see that it's not good. Not good at all. She looks at you in a way people look at puppies when they're leaving them home. With compassion and motherly love.

"Doctor," she says. "I don't think this is a good idea. I mean, you just saw my vagina." She is clearly amused, bites her lip with a glimpse of a smile. "You know it better than my _face_." She raises her eyebrows again. "Are you really asking me for a date?"

You're trying to come up with a good – maybe even funny – reply, but nothing comes to mind. You feel like a 13 year old boy.

"I didn't think so," she smiles and cheerfully leaves the office.

- [Clinic: endMariaEncounter]

---
Clinic: letMariaLeave

You both say good bye. Maria leaves the office and closes the door behind her.

- [Clinic: endMariaEncounter]

---
Clinic: endMariaEncounter

There’s no rational indication she will be back sooner than in 12 months, but for some reason, you know you won't need to wait that long. As the matter of fact, in less then 12 hours, you’ll wish you’d never let Maria Pruitt in your office in the first place.

goingHome

## Unexpected encounter

Two hours later, it's 6pm, there is nothing more to do, and it's time to go home. You get your coat and thank Lydia for the day.

It's chilly outside, but nothing you won't survive. To get home, it's just a 15 minute walk via the downtown lanes and then some 20 more minutes through the residential area. You set out with your chin lowered to protect the neck from the cold. You'd prefer to drive today.

Your father did a lot of driving back in the day, though that was in a time when the economy was doing just fine. You still remember the trips: The whole car just for the two of you. Hours of driving, long distances covered, no reason for it whatsover.

These are good memories, but the relative lack of traffic is not that bad, really. It's much less crowded on the roads, with people taking buses and vans - or carpooling - instead of driving individually. Everyone gets more exercise that way, too. And there's less of that car angst.

A few blocks away from the clinic, you turn left to a narrower street to climb a small hill. It's a little more work for your legs, but this path is much shorter and very quiet. After only a few minutes, the commotion of the city has all but faded, and you feel like you're walking through a village in the country. The path turns to the right, bent around a small park.

"Hey, you!"

You look around. It's already quite dark, but you make out a male figure next to a tree in the park. He walks towards you. The way he moves reveals he has had a few drinks.

"Yeah, prick! You! Come here!"

The suddenness of the situation has you paralyzed. It's not that you fear this person so much -- as he clearly had too much to drink, and is barely standing -- but the sudden change from a pleasant stroll to a possible argument is just too much to process for your brain. Fortunately, the paralysis ends in a few seconds. By then, though, the drunk man stands before you and says: "Hey, du- dumbass! Who d'you think you're look at, huh?" He pushes you with all his force and you - unprepared - fall on your bottom.

This man is clearly looking for a fight.

- Stand up and fight! [Drunk man: standUpAndFight]
- Stand up and run! [Drunk man: run]

Drunk man: run

You jump up and start running towards your home. You are quite surprised to find out the drunk man actually follows you. And he's not that slow, either.

You stand up to fight the drunkard.

You black out completely and only come back to your senses a few hours later. The drunk man is gone, and the street is silent. Your whole body aches as you gather to stand up. You decide never to take this route from work again.

It's almost 4am when you reach your home, __ your bruises, take a shower and finally go to bed.

Morning, Day 2: start

## Day 2: Waking up

It's about 8am in the morning when you realize you're not sleeping any more. Your whole body hurts. Yesterday, you used and abused muscles that you haven't needed for the last several years. You slowly sit up and look out the window. It's a nice view down the street, the calming green of your neighbours' front gardens being a much better sight than the bedroom's interior.

There's something strange going on outside today, though. Two cars are parked in the middle of the road, and two men with baseball bats are quietly talking to each other over the roof of one of them.

<script>
  if (sawErnestsCar == true) {
  	echo("One of the cars is definitely the same you saw last night.");
  } else {
  	echo("The first car is an elegant Lexus sedan with opaque glass.");
  }
  echo("The other one is an old Ford pick-up in a horrible shape and with mud all over the lower parts.");
</script>

The men are standing on the sides of the Ford. The one closer to you is wearing a leather jacket and a cap. He's a big guy, much beefier that the other one, who seems to be just a college kid.

Then the Lexus starts its engine, and both men stop talking. The bigger one walks to the driver's side of the Lexus and bends towards the window, which now slides just a little bit down. The leather jacket listens and nods to someone in the car, then turns directly at you.

- Keep watching [Morning, Day 2: dontLayDown]
- Lay down [Morning, Day 2: layDown]

Morning, Day 2: layDown

You quickly lay down but then realize there's no way they can see you. It's a bright day outside, while you're in a dark room behind a window and a sheer curtain. You slowly sit up again and continue watching.

- [Morning, Day 2: continueWatching]

---
Morning, Day 2: dontLayDown

You realize there's no way those people can see you from outside. It's a bright day outside, while you're in a dark room behind a window and a sheer curtain. You just continue watching.

- [Morning, Day 2: continueWatching]

---
Morning, Day 2: continueWatching

The man in the leather jacket is now pointing at your house and talking to someone in the Lexus. After a few seconds, the window goes up again, the Lexus slowly starts pulling away, and the big guy beckons to the young one.

At last your brain becomes aware of the seriousness of the situation. This is *really* happening.

<script>
  time++;
  if (time == 2) {
  	<echo>
      Through the window, you can see that the two men are now nearing the house. The big guy gestures to the other one, who responds by rushing out towards the back of the house. Apparently, they're not going to let you escape through the back door.
  	</echo>
  } else if (time == 3) {
  	<echo>
      The big guy is now at your front door, presumably getting ready to kick it open or swing the bat at the handle. His accomplice must now be somewhere behind the house, though he still needs to climb over the wooden fence to get to the garden and the back door.

  } else if (time == 4) {

Morning, Day 2: getDressed
[[ visitOnce ]]

You realize you're still in your pyjamas. You quickly hop on your feet. Yesterday's clothes are right there, by the bed, where you left them -- so you start putting them on immediately. This is obviously not the time to worry about a creased shirt.

<script>
  gotDressed = true;

---
Morning, Day 2: lookForWeapon
[[ visitOnce ]]

These men have *baseball bats* -- you are not going to stand a chance bare handed if they reach you. Fortunately, you keep your sporting equipment in a basket in the bedroom closet, so you quickly spring to it and start poking around in it.

You find two pieces of equipment that you can imagine being useful in a fight. A wooden baseball bat not unlike the one those men outside wield, and a golf club.

The baseball bat is shorter and lighter. It will be a little more agile. The golf club is longer and made of steel. It will deal more damage, but will be somewhat harder to lead.

---
Morning, Day 2: callPolice
[[ visitOnce ]]

You find your cell phone and dial the emergency number. There's the "please hold" message, then an operator picks up.

"Please state your emergency."

You tell him there are two men with baseball bats coming into your home. You say you can see them through the window. You try to describe the pickup truck. "It has mud all over it," you say. 

"All right, sir, what is your location?"

"My location?"

"Where are you right now?"

"Oh, I -- eh -- 503 Hyde Road."

"Okay, mister, now lock yourself in, and try to keep those men from entering. Don't risk anything. We are sending a vehicle."

Morning, Day 2: waitedTooLong

There's a loud crash coming from the hallway. The man in the leather jacket must have made his way through the door on the first attempt. You hear no sound coming from the back of the house yet. That's not surprising, as it likely takes some time to go over the fence.

If you run down the stairs and towards the back door, you might still evade the big guy. He'll need some time to find his bearings around the house first, while you'll ideally just slip through towards either of the doors.

You can also just wait in the room and try to fend the intruders off${calledPolice ? " until the police comes" : ""}.

- Run [startRunning]
- Barricade the room [stayInTheRoom]

Morning, Day 2: stayInTheRoom

Morning, Day 2: startRunning

You dash out of the room, make a sharp right and run down the hall towards the stairs.

Maria Car: comingTo

You run through a couple of suburban backyards until you hit a street. It looks very similar to yours, as all streets tend to do in neighbourhoods like this. It's quiet. A long line of uniform houses on each side. Lamps. Garages. You rest for a while, listening. There are no signs of henchmen with baseball bats here. Your heart rate is still extremely high, but it's coming down.

There's only one car parked on the whole street. Since your breathing has calmed down a little, you can now hear the motor is running. You start sweating again. The car is a red Mazda, one that you don't remember seeing today, or yesterday. You swipe the sweat off your eyes and look if someone's at the driver's seat.

There is someone there, looking at you, and your mind goes blank for a second after you realize it's Maria Pruitt. Maria Pruitt, the new patient. Maria Pruitt, the pale bringer of new beginnings. "Maria fucking Pruitt," you find yourself saying almost audibly.

- Run [Maria Car: run]
- Approach the car [Maria Car: approach]

---
Maria Car: run

You are too confused and tired to think about the best possible route of escape, so you pick a side randomly and start running along the road. You quickly realize how stupid this is, running from a car along a road, and you can also hear the Mazda rolling on idle a few paces behind you.

You decide to jump over a fence into someone's front yard, but that's when your legs give in and you land on your knees, breathing in and out so quickly it hurts. Hyperventilation. That's the scientific term for it. There are many causes of hyperventilation, you have been taught, including strokes and various lung diseases, but mostly it's caused by something much less glorious. A panic attack.

As the red Mazda slowly pulls over at your side, you manage to persuade your mind to calm down a bit, and you consciously slow down your breath. By the time Maria Pruitt slides her side window down, you are able to stand up, breathe normally, and talk.

- [Maria Car: sideWindow]

---
Maria Car: approach

Maria watches you walk towards the car with her eyes wide open. She slides the side window down.

- [Maria Car: sideWindow]

---
Maria Car: sideWindow

Before you can say anything, Maria reaches out the side window, grabs your hand, and says, "I am so, so sorry." She looks at your bruises${(gotDressed ? "" : " and your very informal attire")}. "It's all my fault." She looks around the silent street. "Please get in," she says. "We must go now."
