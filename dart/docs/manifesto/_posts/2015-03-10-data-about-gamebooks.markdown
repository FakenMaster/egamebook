I recently ran a miniature survey to gauge interest in [egamebook][] and to find out more about the kind of people who might be interested in it. I thought I'd share what I learned because much of it could be interesting to others.

The survey ran in [Google Consumer Surveys][], which is a tool that lets people do market research. These surveys then run on the web as an alternative to internet pay walls for websites that publish content. The surveys are pretty accurate, at least if you trust Nate Silver, who says that "the Google consumer surveys' election polls were ranked second in terms of reliability and lack of bias in predicting election results." ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Consumer_Surveys)) They are paid --- one answer ranges from $0.10 to about $2.00. 

**Disclaimer:** I am a Google employee. I did pay full price for the survey, though, and I had no internal help setting it up nor running it.

There were only two questions:

1. Do you
2.

With _Consumer Surveys_, you get demographic questions 'for free' --- you don't need to ask how old people are, what their income is, and so on. These pieces of information are inferred and approximated.

## Are you ready for the results?
