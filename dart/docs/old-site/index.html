<p>You opened the page <a href="http://www.egamebook.com/">www.egamebook.com</a> in your browser and you are reading its contents. You are anxious to find out more about this eGameBook thing. The following is written on the page:</p>
<blockquote>
	<strong>eGameBook</strong> is a project which strives to bring the gamebook and Choose-Your-Own-Adventure (CYOA) experience to the mobile platform. True, there are already great examples of mobile Choose-Your-Own-Adventures out there, but our scope is a little broader. We believe that the mobile phone is the future of playing interactive fiction.
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. You scratch your head and read some more.<p>
<blockquote>
	The eGameBook project will make it possible for everyone to make their own gamebooks and CYOA adventures in a multi-platform WISIWYG editor. Even without the editor it's very simple because it's all just HTML (and JavaScript if you want to get advanced). Every single story will be included in a directory with categories, tags and user ratings. When you'll choose the story, it will be downloaded to your phone for off-line browsing.
</blockquote>
<p>"Yeah", you are thinking, "but how far <em>is</em> this project? Isn't it just one of those nice ideas that will <em>never</em> be carried out?"</p>
<blockquote>
	The mobile app is now being developed for the <a href="http://www.android.com/" title="Android | Official Website">Android platform</a> and the current phase already supports categories and downloading stories. The story reader is already (more or less) finished on the CYOA level. In the future, it will allow for much more than just choosing one of multiple options at each stage, though. The gamebooks will be fully programmable, with points, inventory, fights and all.
