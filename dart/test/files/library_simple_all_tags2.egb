start

You are in a room full of spiders. The spiders look annoyed.


---     
squash
[[ visitOnce]]

You try to squash the spiders, but there's too many of them. Oh god,
they're eating your face off now!

<init>  
  b = 2;
</init>
This is just great.

   <declare>
  int c;
</declare>
 ---
run
 [[ visitOnce, showOnce ]]  

You managed to get out of the room before the spiders got to you, but now you're in a room full of giant worms.
