This here is not a textblock, but it's the synopsis. It doesn't live in any of the pages.

<classes>
  class A {
    A() {
    }
  }
</classes>

Same here!


-------------
start

You are in a room full of spiders. The spiders look annoyed.


---     
squash
[[ visitOnce]]

You try to squash the spiders, but there's too many of them. Oh god,
they're eating your face off now!

!
<CLASSES>  
  class B {
    B() {
    }
  }
</classes>
This is just great.

---

this is _not_ a next page

---- neither is this


   <classes>
  class C {
    C() {
    }
  }
</classes>
 ---
run
 [[ visitOnce, showOnce ]]  

You managed to get out of the room before the spiders got to you, but now you're in a room full of giant worms.
