Day1.warnAmy
[[ visitOnce ]]

You grab the phone and speed-dial number one. It takes ages for her to pick up, and when she does, she's sleepy and slow.

surname="Hracek";

"Wha' uppp?"

"Hey baby," you start quickly, "I have pigs outside. Rick must have talked. Go. Go somewhere safe. Somewhere I wouldn't know."

"What?"

You hang up, hoping she got all that. You know you can't lose any more time now.

policeBreakIn

There's a sudden, loud crash _right in the room_ and a man in black overall jumps into the room, through the window, like some sort of a freaking ninja. Everything slows down. He's holding a gun and starts turning it towards you.

<script>
  if (weapon == "gun") {
    <echo>
You react instinctively. There's a loud gunshot and the man falls to the ground. You shot him in the stomach and you know he's wearing an armor, but the sheer shock and power of the impact will incapacitate this guy for some time.

- [runOutTheWindow]
    </echo>
  } else {
    <echo>
You realize you don't have the gun yet, so you instinctively move towards the bed (to which it's taped from below). Though the policeman can't know what you're after, he acts as instinctively as you do -- he shoots you in the right clavicle area. You fall to the ground, screaming with pain.

    </echo>
  }

Day1.runOutTheWindow

You jump through the window, catch hold of some branches of the backyard tree and fall down on the grass with a thump. You hear "Shit!" from the side, so you send a blind shot there, and start running towards the white fence. The adventure begins.

wasted

For the next few hours and days, you just see blurs and colors and you dream nightmares of Amy and the bastard son of yours.

When you finally come to your senses, you're in prison. And you won't be getting out alive.
