Briana shrugs. "How long have you been here?"

"Three years! Gods. A lot has happened. Just this winter, the orcs took over the upper valley. They are raiding way beyond Fort Ironcast now."

"I know. It seemed like a stupid idea even then. I wanted to get in, steal back the Orcthorn, get out, and help win the war."

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
_"What is Orcthorn?"_


"A sword. It’s killed hundreds of orcs, wielded by a half dozen legendary knights. The orcs have been trying to get Orcthorn for decades, almost to no avail."


_"Almost."_


"Yes. Last full moon, an orcish captain and a company of warriors ambushed Lord Glencot. He wielded Orcthorn at the time, and they knew it. They slaughtered his company and brought the sword here, to Bloodrock. Since then, the orcs have been bolder."


_"The Mad Guardian."_


"The mad who?"


_"That is what Agruth and the other slavers were talking about a couple of weeks back. One orc was supposed to guard a sword. That seemed weird enough to me. Guarding a sword? Stranger yet, that orc went mad after only a few days. Now they keep him in a cell, and call him_ grach kamkorr _– The Mad Guardian. That sword is still with him. Hidden there in the cell."_


"Where is that cell?"
