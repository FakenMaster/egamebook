ROOM: $test_fight_goblin


FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
This is a development-only test fight. If you still see this in a production
build, it's a bug.

A goblin stands in front of you, wielding a spear. Between the two of you,
a plain dagger lies on the ground. You also notice a nice, solid rock in the
rubble.

You are barehanded.
