[[IF $(c).isHurt(tamaraId)]]Tamara is sitting on the ground now and tending to her wounds. "I'll survive, [young sir]. But you might not." She winces, and looks at me.[[ELSE]]Tamara checks her gear and sheathes her sword. Then she looks at me.[[ENDIF]] "Come with me back to safety. I'll give you a discount for the way back."

_"Thanks for your service, Tamara. But I've come this far."_

Tamara nods, and leaves without ceremony. In a few moments, she disappears among the trees and the bushes.
