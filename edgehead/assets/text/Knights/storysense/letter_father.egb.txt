COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
I take the letter from my pocket and read it.

Son,

I learned about your plans from a family friend. Although I hope you don't mean to execute them, I am writing this letter. I will come back home as soon as I am able.

There is good life for you in Zamora, despite everything. The plains may seem dull to your young heart, but they are safe, and bountiful.

I am surprised by the brash move. From you, of all people. Remember your health. Stay home and continue your training.

And remember, revenge won't bring your brother back from the dead.

- Father
