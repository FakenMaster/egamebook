## Big O (Ossiris)

Wants to prevent another "Arrival" by being all knowing. The only way to do that: be immortal, or at the very least very long-lived. What are a few thousand dead against the chance that humanity survives the next apocalypse.
 
* "I don't care about how you feel about all this. Cattle can feel. Only a few can think."
* "I am impressed. I truly am. I don't think I had the gift as young as you do. I can spare you, and I ask you of only one thing in exchange. Use your head."

## Oracle

Hippie lover of all things ancient. Nobody touches her because she is too valuable, and people are unsure whether or not she is a wizard (or worse, a tech-mancer). Pronounces tech like teχ in LaTeΧ (with guttural "kh").
 
* "Right on, this is like exactly what I was talking about."
* "Dude, chill. This is intense, sure, but we won't solve this by being all freaked out or whatever."

## Corporal

Main knight.

Torn between duty and rationality (keep Knights alive by retreating) and internal moral compass (honor, defending the helpless). If given the chance, will sacrifice himself.

* "My lad, I wish I saw the world with your eyes, so simple and straightforward. Instead, I live in the hell that is reality."
* "Die, goblin scum! This is for all the young lads and lassies that fell by your dirty swords."

## Darg

An orc. Wants most things. But most of all, wants to please his horde. Literally crowdsourcing leadership. Does not go well. 

## Jisad (Blind Guide)

Hates magic and longs for the simpler times before the Pyramid was a focal point of so much power play. Wants his former life back. He wants his old Pyramid back, the way it was in a brittle equilibrium.

What does he want that clashes with Aren at the start? He wants the Tome of Necromancy to stay hidden, he wants to destroy it. He also hates violence and necromancy.

* "Ah, new blood. Well, welcome to the circus I guess."
* "I am blind, young sir, but I am not stupid. You come here for power, like everyone else. You forget there are people here who just want to live their lives."
* "I will do anything to make this place peaceful again. Just don't ask me to touch magic. Much less _black_ magic."

## Leroy

Son of trader Josepth Siencyn.
 
The name Siencyn is a Welsh variant of "Jenkin" -- an allusion to Leeroy Jenkins.

## Miguel (avid knight at the entrance)

Drank a bit too much of the cool aid. Likes to think he will be the one sacrificing himself in battle. This is his idea of a legacy. To die heroically.

* "There is no glory in defending this place from the _outside_ when all the action happens inside."
* "I don't care what you think, coward."

## Kat (Miguel's master-knight)

Much less avid than Miguel. Just wants to provide strength where needed, doesn't want to fight if not necessary.
