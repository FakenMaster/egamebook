I am also a necromancer. Which might come in handy around here.

"This place is dangerous, [young sir]." This is Tamara, my hired guide. She's walking a few paces in front of me, trying to see through the fog and the wild forest that was once a city.

* "What an insight!"

    Tamara gives me a look. "Extremely funny," she whispers.

    * * "It can't be more dangerous than the journey here."

        Then again, I _have_ seen <>

    * * "Sorry."

        Tamara shrugs, and starts walking again. I look around, at the thick overgrowth. I've seen <>

* "Do you see anything?"

    "No," she whispers. "Trees and leaves and fog. And corpses."

    It's true. I've also seen <>

* "I will keep my eyes open."

Tamara nods. "Good," she whispers, and starts walking again. I look around, at the thick overgrowth. I've seen <>

<> quite a few corpses in the few hours we have been here. (All of them way too old and dry to raise, though.)

Tamara stops. For a moment, she's as still as painting, and I try to mirror her. Then, she nods in the direction of a ferocious goblin stepping out of hiding.

Keeping her teeth together, Tamara says: "I might need your help with this. Take my dagger."

// TODO: make this work - dagger / rock must be held

* "What? I am no warrior." (Refuse the weapon.)

* "Keep it. I'll improvise." (Pick up a rock.)

* "Thanks." (Take the dagger.)

The fight begins.
