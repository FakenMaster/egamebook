FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
(NOTE FOR TESTERS: This area is very much in development.)

I come to the headquarters. A large room overlooking the bay. Latrines on the right, hanging out of the window frames, providing fertilizer to the farmer slope below. To the left, as far from the latrines as possible, the bunks where a few of the knights sleep, and the command tent.

[[CODE]]
// Making sure that Tamara & Briana are not active by now, in case we skip
// the initial fight during debug.
w.updateActorById(tamaraId, (b) => b.isActive = false);
if (w.actors.build().any((a) => a.id == brianaId)) {
  w.updateActorById(brianaId, (b) => b.isActive = false);    
}

NOTES:

ACTION: $talk_to_corporal
DESCRIPTION:
The corporal says there's not much the Knights can do. They are retreating in any case. But he does feel responsible. Maybe if I go and help Zee (a knight) with a counter attack, that could give everyone more time to evacuate. I could also help by persuading the Farmers to evacuate. They don't want to.
