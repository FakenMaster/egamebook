# Trying out the new room setup

APPROACH: $battlefield FROM $___
COMMAND: Go >> to the battlefield
DESCRIPTION: [We] climb up the stairs to thirty third floor.

ROOM: $battlefield
WHERE: among the columns
FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
It's very different from the other floors. There are no walls, and from the staircase opening one can see all the windows. There are rows of columns and two larger structures housing the staircases and the elevator, but this is the closest the Pyramid has to an open field. There is a strange smell here that I can't quite place.

As soon as [we] make the last stair and enter the floor proper, two orcs step out of from behind the columns. One of them is wearing a red tunic and wields a serrated sword. Possibly a captain of some kind. The other one has the usual brown leather jerkin and wields a battle axe.

"Big mistake," the red orc is saying with mock sadness. "Big mistake for you. This is no longer a place for human garbage like you."

"Big mistake for him," the leather jerkin agrees. "But good news for us. XYZ rewards human scalps."

The two orcs attack.

AFTER_MONSTERS_CLEARED:
Whatever the reason for this cleared space had been in the ancient times, I can imagine how the Knights preferred it for battle when they still had the numbers. There is no way to go past it, and the plan is so open you can conceivably use archers, and formations.

"Why did the Knights ever retreat from here? It's perfect."

"Perfect for fair fight, yes," [companion] says.
