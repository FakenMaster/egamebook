# Main characters #ref

## Aren

An outsider coming from "Cannibal country", from the mountains. His country is called "Falling Rock". In those parts, Necromancy is forbidden. It's backwater, and relatively safer than San Francisco.

Contrast: sickly-looking person -- a powerful necromancer & swordsman


## Big O (Osiris)

Wants to prevent another "Arrival" by being all knowing. The only way to do that: be immortal, or at the very least very long-lived. What are a few thousand dead against the chance that humanity survives the next apocalypse.
 
* "I don't care about how you feel about all this. Cattle can feel. Only a few can think."
* "I am impressed. I truly am. I don't think I had the gift as young as you do. I can spare you, and I ask you of only one thing in exchange. Use your head."

Contrast: very noble looking and stoic -- actually vicious


## Oracle

Hippie lover of all things ancient. Nobody touches her because she is too valuable, and people are unsure whether or not she is a wizard (or worse, a tech-mancer). Pronounces tech like teχ in LaTeΧ (with guttural "kh").
 
* "Right on, this is, oh, exactly what I was talking about."
* "Dude, chill. This is intense, sure, but we won't solve this by being all freaked out."

Contrast: impractical wise person -- actually has a stash of weapons and a pretty decent plan of defense.


## Corporal

Main knight.

Torn between duty and rationality (keep Knights alive by retreating) and internal moral compass (honor, defending the helpless). If given the chance, will sacrifice himself.

* "My lad, I wish I saw the world with your eyes, so simple and straightforward. Instead, I live in the hell that is reality."
* "Die, goblin scum! This is for all the young lads and lassies that fell by your dirty swords."

Contrast: a sensible leader -- actually wants to die to achieve nirvana.


## Darg

An orc. Wants to please his horde. Literally crowdsourcing leadership. Does not go well because following the lowest common denominator is not leadership.

* "I'm just doing what the Crowd wants. Who am I to tell them anything else."


## Jisad (Blind Guide)

Hates magic and longs for the simpler times before the Pyramid was a focal point of so much power play. Wants his former life back. He wants his old Pyramid back, the way it was in a brittle equilibrium.

What does he want that clashes with Aren at the start? He wants the Tome of Necromancy to stay hidden, he wants to destroy it. He also hates violence and necromancy.

* "Ah, new blood. Well, welcome to the circus I guess."
* "I am blind, young sir, but I am not stupid. You come here for power, like everyone else. You forget there are people here who just want to live their lives."
* "I will do anything to make this place peaceful again. Just don't ask me to touch magic. Much less _black_ magic."

Contrast: blind old man -- actually bad ass.


## Leroy

The son of trader Joseph Siencyn.
 
The name Siencyn is a Welsh variant of "Jenkins" -- an allusion to Leeroy Jenkins.


## Miguel (the avid knight at the entrance)

Drank a bit too much of the cool aid. Likes to think he will be the one sacrificing himself in battle. This is his idea of a legacy. To die heroically.

* "There is no glory in defending this place from the _outside_ when all the action happens inside."
* "I don't care what you think, coward."

Contrast: a "bro", talks about glory -- actually terrified for the farmers


## Kat (Miguel's master-knight)

Kat is much less avid than Miguel. Just wants to provide strength where needed, doesn't want to fight if not necessary.

* ...

Contrast: serious, stoic, professional -- cries when alone
