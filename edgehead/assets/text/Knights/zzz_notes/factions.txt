# Factions #ref

## Blessed
The people below the elevator shaft. Cannibals.

## Humans

These are "us". Aren is one of them. The farmers are them. The Knights of San Francisco are them. Even bandits are them, to an extent.
 
This article covers things that are common among most humans in the world of Grayshore. Most human factions (e.g. farmers, Knights) add to this base with their own characteristics. Some human factions change almost everything that defines humanity (e.g. the Blessed with their fanatic cannibalism and disinterest in normal human society).

### Religion
Open. No religion has sway over others. There are good old Christian religions, muslim religions, but also polytheistic religions that combine those and other myths.
 
One of the religions is Tolkienism, where JRR Toliken is a prophet of God Iluvatar.
