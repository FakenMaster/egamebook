Here I am in the ancient ruins of San Francisco. After a month long journey, I have finally reached my destination. My brother is here, somewhere.

* I am a young girl >> with black curly hair >> and a large debt.

I am also a necromancer. Which might come in handy around here. This place is dangerous. I've seen quite a few corpses in the few hours I have been here. (All of them too old to raise, though, with my skill.)

"Young [lady], we might have a problem." This is Tamara, my hired guide. She is standing next to me and drawing her sword.

* "What is it, Lady Tamara?"

Tamara nods in the direction of <>

* "What now?"

Tamara nods in the direction of <>

* Look around.

I see <>

-

<> a ferocious goblin stepping out of hiding.

Tamara glances in my direction.

"I might need your help with this. Take my dagger."

* Take the dagger from Tamara's belt.

* Take a rock from the ground instead.

* Take a step back.

The fight begins.
