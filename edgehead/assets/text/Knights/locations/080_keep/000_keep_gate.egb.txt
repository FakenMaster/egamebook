ROOM: $keep_gate

FLAGS: $IDLE

POS: 15, 86

FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
The plain, ancient geometry of the Pyramid's hallways is suddenly disrupted by a massive gate. The gate is from dark, richly ornamented redwood. 

This is a lord's house, except it doesn't stand on top of a hill or next to a lake. Instead, it is embedded in the ancient building.

DESCRIPTION: $NONE
