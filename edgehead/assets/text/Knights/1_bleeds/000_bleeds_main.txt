FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I finally see it. The Pyramid.

A little village, more of a tent camp, stands outside of the entrance. Later, I learn the locals call the settlement The Bleeds.

It was harder than I expected but I made it here. The Manual is somewhere here. I can find it.

DESCRIPTION:
Lots of shacks and their inhabitants.
