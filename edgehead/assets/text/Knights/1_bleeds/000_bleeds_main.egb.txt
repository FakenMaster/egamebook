FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I finally see it. The Pyramid.

// TODO: add image

Below the Pyramid there's a small village. It huddles around the entrance to the structure. Later, I learn the locals call the settlement “The Bleeds”.

// Making sure that Tamara & Briana are not active by now, in case we skip
// the initial fight during debug.
w.updateActorById(tamaraId, (b) => b.isActive = false);

  w.updateActorById(brianaId, (b) => b.isActive = false);

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_PROBABILITY: 100%

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
At any point I can see at least a few villagers going about their business. Their pace is fast and long, and they seldom talk to each other. Something bad is happening.

Every door is shut except for two. One is the entrance into a trader's shop. The second open door belongs to a small dwelling with a porch. A blind man sits outside on a stool, wearing a coat.

I see a pillar of smoke to the west of here. Looks like nothing more than a camp fire.
