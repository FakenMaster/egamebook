FIRST_DESCRIPTION:
I finally see it. The Pyramid.

// TODO: add image

Below the Pyramid there's a small village. It huddles around the entrance to the structure. Later, I learn the locals call the settlement “The Bleeds”.

There is a trader's shop here. A mile to the west, I see a pillar of black smoke rising to the sky.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_PROBABILITY: 100%

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
At any point I can see at least a few villagers going about their business. Their pace is fast and long, and they seldom talk to each other. Something bad is happening.

Every door is shut except for two. One is the entrance into the trader's shop. The second open door belongs to a small dwelling with a porch. A blind man sits outside on a stool, wearing a coat.

COMPLETE_SUCCESS_DESCRIPTION:
The smoke is black as death but the pillar is narrow. Looks like nothing more than a camp fire.

Someone is not afraid to be found.
