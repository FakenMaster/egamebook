The walls are smoother. \n\n\nYou hear heavy breathing and rustling up ahead, and you stop in your tracks, next to a small reinforced door.\n\n\nA human slave runs down the passage toward you. His arm is visibly broken just above the elbow and blood is streaming down his limping left leg. His lips move but he makes no sound. Eyes blurred with tears, he doesn\'t see you.\n\n\nBefore you can so much as call to him, something long and sharp shoots from behind the slave. A bloodied spearhead appears in the center of the man\'s chest, as if it grew from his body. His tearful eyes glance at the fatal wound. Two more steps toward you and the slave falls face down, the shaft of the spear protruding from his back.\n\n\nAn orc and a goblin appear from the tunnel, walking toward the dead man. The orc is laughing, patting his companion on the back. "Vicious throw, small one!" he roars.\n\n\nYou step back and motion to Briana to lean against the wall, hoping that the door\'s reinforced frame will keep you hidden from the two slavers.\n\n\nBut right then, something or someone pounds on the reinforced door from the inside. You hear loud and angry growls.\n\n\nThe two slavers are now looking directly at you. The goblin yanks his spear from the corpse, and the orc unsheathes his sword.

You lean out from your hiding place and see a section of the wall to the right of the altar opening.\n\n\nAn orc priest, tall and pale, enters through the stone door. Suddenly, the whole temple reverberates with a strong, dissonant tone that is both sickening and powerful. As if the whole mountain were groaning. \n\n\nFollowing the orc priest, a huge creature enters through the door, crouching below its frame. It\'s unclear what the creature is, exactly, but it could be some large breed of ogre. Judging by the braided hair, it\'s a female. Her sword — attached to her hip with a rope — is as long as you are tall. \n\n\nWhen she enters the temple and stands upright, you can see that she is leading someone in by a chain. An orc. Despite being a strong one, probably a captain or even a chieftain, he is dwarfed by the creature before him, and he visibly shakes in horror.\n\n\nThe three of them — the priest, the ogre and the orc — walk to the front of the altar and stand before it, facing the symbol of the octopus, their backs facing you and Briana.\n\n\nThe dissonant tone stops. You lean a little further out from your hiding place to have a better view.\n\n\nWithout words, the priest beckons the orc to lie at the altar. The orc is now shaking uncontrollably, but he obeys. You can hear his fitful breath, the rustle of his body against the stone as he glides into position, and nothing else.\n\n\nWhen the orc lies on the altar, the female ogre walks up to him and places her hands on his shoulders, pinning him down.\n\n\nSomehow, you know.\n\n\n_"Maggots."_\n\n\nBriana gives you a puzzled look, then turns back to the ritual. From the shadows in the base of the altar, a swarm of large black insects starts to make its way up toward the terrified orc. The priest lifts his arms in silent worship.\n\n\n![Picture of the sadistic slavers](https://egamebook.com/vermin/v/latest/img/altar.jpg)\n\n\nThe ogre pushes down on the orc, preparing for the inevitable struggle. The orc knows what’s coming, and he opens his mouth to scream.\n\n\nBut the scream doesn\'t come. Instead, the dissonant tone sounds again, more powerful than before.\n\n\nThe maggots crawl over the edge of the altar\'s surface, onto the orc\'s body, and move straight toward his face. They move faster now.\n\n\nThe orc\'s eyes go wide. He struggles against the ogre\'s grip, to no avail. The dissonant tone gets even louder. The whole temple quivers. You feel like your ear drums will collapse. The sound permeates everything.\n\n\nSuddenly, the terror of the moment is fully replaced by an invigorating feeling of power. You take a breath and feel stronger, refreshed.\n\n\n<p class="toast">Your stamina increases by 1.</p>\n\n\nYou notice that the priest inhales deeply as well.\n\n\nThen, the sound stops and the orc\'s body collapses into itself. The invigorating feeling is gone. You realize the maggots have eaten through the orc\'s eyes and cheeks, and that they are now scuttling back to the base of the altar.\n\n\nThe priest puts his arms down again and — without saying anything — heads back to the stone door. The ogre takes the orc\'s dead body, throws it over her shoulder, and follows the priest. In a few heartbeats, they are all gone and the door closes. A new pool of blood on the altar is the only reminder of what happened.\n\n\nBriana stares ahead. "How did you know it would be maggots?"\n\n\n_"I do not know."_\n\n\n"I _felt_ that sound, somehow. I _felt_ it."\n\n\n_"This place does something weird to people."_\n\n\n"And if that orc was meant to be an offering, why did they not leave the body?" Briana shakes her head.
