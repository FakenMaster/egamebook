You've just installed an application called eGameBook on your Android device. You're testing it to see what it has to offer, but after a few seconds you realize that while you thought you were reading an introduction, you've actually started playing the game itself. The game starts with you starting the game.

That makes you a whole lot uncertain, even existentially so. Are you really playing the game? Or are you just an avatar *in* someone else's game? Is someone out there holding an Android device the size of your universe, and reading about you holding an Android device the size of someone else's universe? Where does it end? What does it all mean? What should you do?

"This game sucks!" You shake your head. "Where's the action?" You wonder why you downloaded the app in the first place. What were you thinking? A gamebook? In the 21st century? You own an expensive high tech gadget to play a freaking gamebook? To *read* shit? If you wanted to read, why the hell would you use something as advanced for it? Gamebooks are for suckers who can't afford a computer. You're certainly not one of them.

While you're pondering whether you should just remove the app right away or give it some more time, something suddenly feels very strange. You can sense a sort of an abstract change. A certain disconnect. As if a part of you just went to sleep, or left, or died. You don't understand. These feelings - you've never had these. This is new. You feel dead. Transported. Unplugged. Energized. All at the same time.

You're still reading the introductory page of the gamebook app, when the phone rings. It's a number you don't recognize: +113 5544 3333. It's fairly easy to remember, so it might be a corporate number. Is it some annoying operator calling you with some offer you can't (and will) refuse?

What do yo do?
# Answer it. (002)
# Wait till the ringing ends. 
# Deny the call.

Club Here - google the number

#002

You answer the call and move the phone to your ear. For a while, there is no sound at the other end of the line, then you hear someone inhaling end exhaling. You decide to wait.

After a while, a woman's voice says: "Come... here." You anticipate more, but that's it. The other side hangs up.

Well that was rude! Did someone just call you, said "Come here" and hang up? Who the hell would do that? Why? You didn't recognize the woman's voice nor the number. You have no idea what "here" she was talking about.

How do you react?
# Ignore the call and get back to whatever you were doing until now.
# Use the search engine: ______
# Call someone to share the strange incident.
