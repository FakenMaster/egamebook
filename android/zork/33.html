"Biv, let's take the passage with all the footprints. It's obviously the
most traveled path."
</P>
<P>
"Suits me," agrees Bivotar.

The passage descends sharply, and in many places there are steps carved
into the stone floor to make travel easier. At the bottom of one such
flight, they come across the skeleton of an unfortunate adventurer, his
bones picked clean by some carnivorous denizens of the Great Underground
Empire. Lying next to the skeleton is an empty brown sack and a sturdy
shovel.

<P>
"I'm going to hang onto this shovel," says Juranda.
</P>
<P>
"Might be useful," agrees Bivotar.
</P>

Further along, the passage ends at a large cavern. A stream runs through
the center of the cavern. At the water's edge stands a large stone hut.
</P>
<P>
"It looks deserted," says Bivotar, peering in a window of the hut.
</P>
<P>
"Good place to eat lunch, I'd say."
