# You. Are. Awesome.

Thank you for downloading **eGameBook**! This application strives to bring gamebooks and Choose-Your-Own-Adventures to the Android platform, while giving talented writers a way to publish their work.

This public beta is just the beginning. We're supporting only the most basic adventures right now, but we have big plans. Oh yes we have! And we'd like *you* to take part in designing the application and making it great.

Please [contact us](contact.html) if you

* dislike anything about the current design,
* have an interesting idea for development,
* or need anything else.

[Touch me here](details.html) if you want to know the details of our design. (**Writing gamebooks is super easy!**)

Now you can **start browsing the available stories** by pressing the Back button on your Android device. (This thing you're reading right now is also &mdash; technically &mdash; a story. We just took the liberty to lead you here by default, since it appears to be the first time you opened the application.)
