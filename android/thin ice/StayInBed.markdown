Stay in Bed
----

You decide it's just a bad dream. Ignoring the sound of glass shattering on the floor, you close your eyes and try to revive the dream you just had. 

It doesn't come, though.

A few seconds pass and then a bullet cuts violently through your flesh, opening a hole in your right lung. You try to breathe in, but it's too painful and you choke. 

Blood floods your right shoulder. Even before you realize you're dying, another bullet flies through your head and disconnects most of the crucial circuitry there.

You die.
