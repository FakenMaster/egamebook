Roll over to the right
-----

You quickly roll from the bed and down on the parquet floor. Your hands get cut on the little shards of glass, but you manage to crawl to the wall, out of the assumed sight of the shooter. You quickly scan the outside &mdash; from your position, you only see the sky, so if the shooter isn't flying a helicopter, you should be safe here. 

But of course, you can't stay here forever, and the only way out is across the room and through the door, since you rolled over to the corner opposite the exit.

You realize that the more time you spend here, the more time the shooter has to prepare the second shot. On the other hand, there just might be something handy laying around the mess that is your bedroom.

What do you do now?

* [Look around](BaseballBat.html) a bit to see if there's something useful here.
* [Run to the other side](RunAroundBed.html), around the bed.
* [Roll over the top of the bed](RollOverBed.html).
* [Wait a second or two](WaitInCorner.html) to calm down and take a breath.
